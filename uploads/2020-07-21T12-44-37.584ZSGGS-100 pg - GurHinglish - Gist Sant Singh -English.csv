P0001L02,Chant And Meditate:
P0001L03,True In The Primal Beginning. True Throughout The Ages.
P0001L04,"True Here And Now. O Nanak, Forever And Ever True. ||1||"
P0001L05,"By thinking, He cannot be reduced to thought, even by thinking hundreds of thousands of times."
P0001L06,"By remaining silent, inner silence is not obtained, even by remaining lovingly absorbed deep within."
P0001L07,"The hunger of the hungry is not appeased, even by piling up loads of worldly goods."
P0001L08,"Hundreds of thousands of clever tricks, but not even one of them will go along with you in the end."
P0001L09,So how can you become truthful? And how can the veil of illusion be torn away?
P0001L10,"O Nanak, it is written that you shall obey the Hukam of His Command, and walk in the Way of His Will. ||1||"
P0001L11,"By His Command, bodies are created; His Command cannot be described."
P0001L12,"By His Command, souls come into being; by His Command, glory and greatness are obtained."
P0001L13,"By His Command, some are high and some are low; by His Written Command, pain and pleasure are obtained."
P0001L14,"Some, by His Command, are blessed and forgiven; others, by His Command, wander aimlessly forever."
P0001L15,Everyone is subject to His Command; no one is beyond His Command.
P0001L16,"O Nanak, one who understands His Command, does not speak in ego. ||2||"
P0001L17,Some sing of His Power-who has that Power?
P0001L18,"Some sing of His Gifts, and know His Sign and Insignia."
P0001L19,"Some sing of His Glorious Virtues, Greatness and Beauty."
P0001L20,"Some sing of knowledge obtained of Him, through difficult philosophical studies."
P0001L21,"Some sing that He fashions the body, and then again reduces it to dust."
P0001L22,"Some sing that He takes life away, and then again restores it."
P0001L23,Some sing that He seems so very far away.
P0002L01,"Some sing that He watches over us, face to face, ever-present."
P0002L02,There is no shortage of those who preach and teach.
P0002L03,Millions upon millions offer millions of sermons and stories.
P0002L04,"The Great Giver keeps on giving, while those who receive grow weary of receiving."
P0002L05,"Throughout the ages, consumers consume."
P0002L06,"The Commander, by His Command, leads us to walk on the Path."
P0002L07,"O Nanak, He blossoms forth, Carefree and Untroubled. ||3||"
P0002L08,"True is the Master, True is His Name-speak it with infinite love."
P0002L09,"People beg and pray, """"Give to us, give to us"""", and the Great Giver gives His Gifts."
P0002L10,"So what offering can we place before Him, by which we might see the Darbaar of His Court?"
P0002L11,What words can we speak to evoke His Love?
P0002L12,"In the Amrit Vaylaa, the ambrosial hours before dawn, chant the True Name, and contemplate His Glorious Greatness."
P0002L13,"By the karma of past actions, the robe of this physical body is obtained. By His Grace, the Gate of Liberation is found."
P0002L14,"O Nanak, know this well: the True One Himself is All. ||4||"
P0002L15,"He cannot be established, He cannot be created."
P0002L16,He Himself is Immaculate and Pure.

P0002L18,"O Nanak, sing of the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence."
P0002L19,"Sing, and listen, and let your mind be filled with love."
P0002L20,"Your pain shall be sent far away, and peace shall come to your home."
P0002L21,The Guru's Word is the Sound-current of the Naad; the Guru's Word is the Wisdom of the Vedas; the Guru's Word is all-pervading.
P0002L22,"The Guru is Shiva, the Guru is Vishnu and Brahma; the Guru is Paarvati and Lakhshmi."
P0002L23,"Even knowing God, I cannot describe Him; He cannot be described in words."
P0002L24,The Guru has given me this one understanding:
P0002L25,"There is only the One, the Giver of all souls. May I never forget Him! ||5||"
P0002L26,"If I am pleasing to Him, then that is my pilgrimage and cleansing bath. Without pleasing Him, what good are ritual cleansings?"
P0002L27,"I gaze upon all the created beings: without the karma of good actions, what are they given to receive?"
P0002L28,"Within the mind are gems, jewels and rubies, if you listen to the Guru's Teachings, even once."
P0002L29,The Guru has given me this one understanding:
P0002L30,"There is only the One, the Giver of all souls. May I never forget Him! ||6||"
P0002L31,"Even if you could live throughout the four ages, or even ten times more,"
P0002L32,"And even if you were known throughout the nine continents and followed by all,"
P0002L33,"With a good name and reputation, with praise and fame throughout the world-"
P0002L34,"Still, if the Lord does not bless you with His Glance of Grace, then who cares? What is the use?"
P0002L35,"Among worms, you would be considered a lowly worm, and even contemptible sinners would hold you in contempt."
P0002L36,"O Nanak, God blesses the unworthy with virtue, and bestows virtue on the virtuous."
P0002L37,No one can even imagine anyone who can bestow virtue upon Him. ||7||
P0002L38,"Listening-the Siddhas, the spiritual teachers, the heroic warriors, the yogic masters."
P0002L39,"Listening-the earth, its support and the Akaashic ethers."
P0002L40,"Listening-the oceans, the lands of the world and the nether regions of the underworld."

P0003L15,One who tries to describe this shall regret the attempt.
P0003L16,"No paper, no pen, no scribe"

P0003L43,The actions of the Creator cannot be counted.
P0003L44,"The mythical bull is Dharma, the son of compassion;"
P0003L45,This is what patiently holds the earth in its place.
P0003L46,One who understands this becomes truthful.
P0003L47,What a great load there is on the bull!
P0003L48,So many worlds beyond this world-so very many!
P0003L49,"What power holds them, and supports their weight?"
P0003L50,The names and the colors of the assorted species of beings
P0003L51,Were all inscribed by the Ever-flowing Pen of God.

P0004L29,"As He ordains, so do we receive."
P0004L30,The created universe is the manifestation of Your Name.
P0004L31,"Without Your Name, there is no place at all."
P0004L32,How can I describe Your Creative Power?
P0004L33,I cannot even once be a sacrifice to You.

P0004L39,Soap can wash them clean.
P0004L40,"But when the intellect is stained and polluted by sin,"
P0004L41,It can only be cleansed by the Love of the Name.
P0004L42,Virtue and vice do not come by mere words;
P0004L43,"Actions repeated, over and over again, are engraved on the soul."
P0004L44,You shall harvest what you plant.
P0004L45,"O Nanak, by the Hukam of God's Command, we come and go in reincarnation. ||20||"

P0004L55,"What was that season, and what was that month, when the Universe was created?"

P0004L57,"That time is not known to the Qazis, who study the Koran."

P0005L01,"O Nanak, everyone speaks of Him, each one wiser than the rest."
P0005L02,"Great is the Master, Great is His Name. Whatever happens is according to His Will."
P0005L03,"O Nanak, one who claims to know everything shall not be decorated in the world hereafter. ||21||"
P0005L04,"There are nether worlds beneath nether worlds, and hundreds of thousands of heavenly worlds above."

P0005L10,The streams and rivers flowing into the ocean do not know its vastness.
P0005L11,"Even kings and emperors, with mountains of property and oceans of wealth"
P0005L12,"-these are not even equal to an ant, who does not forget God. ||23||"

P0005L17,The limits of the created universe cannot be perceived.
P0005L18,Its limits here and beyond cannot be perceived.
P0005L19,"Many struggle to know His limits,"
P0005L20,But His limits cannot be found.
P0005L21,No one can know these limits.

P0005L28,"O Nanak, by His Glance of Grace, He bestows His Blessings. ||24||"
P0005L29,His Blessings are so abundant that there can be no written account of them.
P0005L30,The Great Giver does not hold back anything.
P0005L31,"There are so many great, heroic warriors begging at the Door of the Infinite Lord."
P0005L32,"So many contemplate and dwell upon Him, that they cannot be counted."
P0005L33,So many waste away to death engaged in corruption.
P0005L34,"So many take and take again, and then deny receiving."
P0005L35,So many foolish consumers keep on consuming.
P0005L36,"So many endure distress, deprivation and constant abuse."
P0005L37,"Even these are Your Gifts, O Great Giver!"
P0005L38,Liberation from bondage comes only by Your Will.
P0005L39,No one else has any say in this.
P0005L40,"If some fool should presume to say that he does,"
P0005L41,"He shall learn, and feel the effects of his folly."
P0005L42,"He Himself knows, He Himself gives."
P0005L43,"Few, very few are those who acknowledge this."
P0005L44,"One who is blessed to sing the Praises of the Lord,"
P0005L45,"O Nanak, is the king of kings. ||25||"
P0005L46,"Priceless are His Virtues, Priceless are His Dealings."
P0005L47,"Priceless are His Dealers, Priceless are His Treasures."

P0005L53,"Priceless is His Mercy, Priceless is His Royal Command."

P0005L55,"Speak of Him continually, and remain absorbed in His Love."
P0005L56,The Vedas and the Puraanas speak.

P0006L10,He is as Great as He wishes to be.
P0006L11,"O Nanak, the True Lord knows."
P0006L12,"If anyone presumes to describe God,"
P0006L13,He shall be known as the greatest fool of fools! ||26||

P0006L30,"That True Lord is True, Forever True, and True is His Name."
P0006L31,"He is, and shall always be. He shall not depart, even when this Universe which He has created departs."
P0006L32,"He created the world, with its various colors, species of beings, and the variety of Maya."

P0014L14,"If I were to become an emperor and raise a huge army, and sit on a throne,"
P0014L15,"Issuing commands and collecting taxes-O Nanak, all of this could pass away like a puff of wind."
P0014L16,"Seeing these, I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind. ||4||1||"
P0014L17,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0014L18,"If I could live for millions and millions of years, and if the air was my food and drink,"
P0014L19,"And if I lived in a cave and never saw either the sun or the moon, and if I never slept, even in dreams"
P0014L20,"-even so, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? ||1||"
P0014L21,"The True Lord, the Formless One, is Himself in His Own Place."
P0014L22,"I have heard, over and over again, and so I tell the tale; as it pleases You, Lord, please instill within me the yearning for You. ||1||Pause||"
P0014L23,"If I was slashed and cut into pieces, over and over again, and put into the mill and ground into flour,"
P0014L24,Burnt by fire and mixed with ashes
P0014L25,"-even then, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? ||2||"
P0014L26,"If I was a bird, soaring and flying through hundreds of heavens,"
P0014L27,"And if I was invisible, neither eating nor drinking anything"
P0014L28,"-even so, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? ||3||"
P0015L01,"O Nanak, if I had hundreds of thousands of stacks of paper, and if I were to read and recite and embrace love for the Lord,"
P0015L02,"And if ink were never to fail me, and if my pen were able to move like the wind"
P0015L03,"-even so, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? ||4||2||"
P0015L04,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0015L05,"As it is pre-ordained, people speak their words. As it is pre-ordained, they consume their food."
P0015L06,"As it is pre-ordained, they walk along the way. As it is pre-ordained, they see and hear."
P0015L07,"As it is pre-ordained, they draw their breath. Why should I go and ask the scholars about this? ||1||"
P0015L08,"O Baba, the splendor of Maya is deceptive."
P0015L09,"The blind man has forgotten the Name; he is in limbo, neither here nor there. ||1||Pause||"
P0015L10,Life and death come to all who are born. Everything here gets devoured by Death.
P0015L11,"He sits and examines the accounts, there where no one goes along with anyone."
P0015L12,Those who weep and wail might just as well all tie bundles of straw. ||2||
P0015L13,Everyone says that God is the Greatest of the Great. No one calls Him any less.
P0015L14,"No one can estimate His Worth. By speaking of Him, His Greatness is not increased."
P0015L15,"You are the One True Lord and Master of all the other beings, of so many worlds. ||3||"
P0015L16,"Nanak seeks the company of the lowest of the low class, the very lowest of the low."
P0015L17,Why should he try to compete with the great?
P0015L18,"In that place where the lowly are cared for-there, the Blessings of Your Glance of Grace rain down. ||4||3||"
P0015L19,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0015L20,Greed is a dog; falsehood is a filthy street-sweeper. Cheating is eating a rotting carcass.
P0015L21,Slandering others is putting the filth of others into your own mouth. The fire of anger is the outcaste who burns dead bodies at the crematorium.
P0015L22,"I am caught in these tastes and flavors, and in self-conceited praise. These are my actions, O my Creator! ||1||"
P0015L23,"O Baba, speak only that which will bring you honor."
P0015L24,"They alone are good, who are judged good at the Lord's Door. Those with bad karma can only sit and weep. ||1||Pause||"
P0015L25,"The pleasures of gold and silver, the pleasures of women, the pleasure of the fragrance of sandalwood,"
P0015L26,"The pleasure of horses, the pleasure of a soft bed in a palace, the pleasure of sweet treats and the pleasure of hearty meals"
P0015L27,"-these pleasures of the human body are so numerous; how can the Naam, the Name of the Lord, find its dwelling in the heart? ||2||"
P0015L28,"Those words are acceptable, which, when spoken, bring honor."
P0015L29,"Harsh words bring only grief. Listen, O foolish and ignorant mind!"
P0015L30,Those who are pleasing to Him are good. What else is there to be said? ||3||
P0015L31,"Wisdom, honor and wealth are in the laps of those whose hearts remain permeated with the Lord."
P0015L32,What praise can be offered to them? What other adornments can be bestowed upon them?
P0015L33,"O Nanak, those who lack the Lord's Glance of Grace cherish neither charity nor the Lord's Name. ||4||4||"
P0015L34,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0015L35,The Great Giver has given the intoxicating drug of falsehood.
P0015L36,"The people are intoxicated; they have forgotten death, and they have fun for a few days."
P0015L37,Those who do not use intoxicants are true; they dwell in the Court of the Lord. ||1||
P0015L38,"O Nanak, know the True Lord as True."
P0015L39,"Serving Him, peace is obtained; you shall go to His Court with honor. ||1||Pause||"
P0015L40,The Wine of Truth is not fermented from molasses. The True Name is contained within it.
P0016L01,I am a sacrifice to those who hear and chant the True Name.
P0016L02,Only one who obtains a room in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is deemed to be truly intoxicated. ||2||

P0016L12,"Write the Praises of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; write over and over again that He has no end or limitation. ||1||"
P0016L13,"O Baba, write such an account,"
P0016L14,"That when it is asked for, it will bring the Mark of Truth. ||1||Pause||"
P0016L15,"There, where greatness, eternal peace and everlasting joy are bestowed,"
P0016L16,The faces of those whose minds are attuned to the True Name are anointed with the Mark of Grace.
P0016L17,"If one receives God's Grace, then such honors are received, and not by mere words. ||2||"
P0016L18,"Some come, and some arise and depart. They give themselves lofty names."
P0016L19,"Some are born beggars, and some hold vast courts."
P0016L20,"Going to the world hereafter, everyone shall realize that without the Name, it is all useless. ||3||"
P0016L21,"I am terrified by the Fear of You, God. Bothered and bewildered, my body is wasting away."
P0016L22,Those who are known as sultans and emperors shall be reduced to dust in the end.
P0016L23,"O Nanak, arising and departing, all false attachments are cut away. ||4||6||"
P0016L24,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0016L25,"Believing, all tastes are sweet. Hearing, the salty flavors are tasted;"
P0016L26,"Chanting with one's mouth, the spicy flavors are savored. All these spices have been made from the Sound-current of the Naad."
P0016L27,The thirty-six flavors of ambrosial nectar are in the Love of the One Lord; they are tasted only by one who is blessed by His Glance of Grace. ||1||
P0016L28,"O Baba, the pleasures of other foods are false."
P0016L29,"Eating them, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind. ||1||Pause||"
P0016L30,My mind is imbued with the Lord's Love; it is dyed a deep crimson. Truth and charity are my white clothes.
P0016L31,"The blackness of sin is erased by my wearing of blue clothes, and meditation on the Lord's Lotus Feet is my robe of honor."
P0016L32,"Contentment is my cummerbund, Your Name is my wealth and youth. ||2||"
P0016L33,"O Baba, the pleasures of other clothes are false."
P0016L34,"Wearing them, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind. ||1||Pause||"
P0016L35,"The understanding of Your Way, Lord, is horses, saddles and bags of gold for me."
P0016L36,"The pursuit of virtue is my bow and arrow, my quiver, sword and scabbard."
P0016L37,To be distinguished with honor is my drum and banner. Your Mercy is my social status. ||3||
P0016L38,"O Baba, the pleasures of other rides are false."
P0016L39,"By such rides, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind. ||1||Pause||"
P0016L40,"The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the pleasure of houses and mansions. Your Glance of Grace is my family, Lord."

P0017L02,"O Nanak, the True King does not seek advice from anyone else in His decisions. ||4||"
P0017L03,"O Baba, the pleasure of other sleep is false."

P0017L08,"-with that wisdom, chant the Praises of the True Name, the Treasure of Excellence. ||1||"
P0017L09,"O Baba, other wisdom is useless and irrelevant."
P0017L10,"If falsehood is practiced a hundred times, it is still false in its effects. ||1||Pause||"
P0017L11,You may be worshipped and adored as a Pir (a spiritual teacher); you may be welcomed by all the world;
P0017L12,"You may adopt a lofty name, and be known to have supernatural spiritual powers"
P0017L13,"-even so, if you are not accepted in the Court of the Lord, then all this adoration is false. ||2||"
P0017L14,No one can overthrow those who have been established by the True Guru.
P0017L15,"The Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is within them, and through the Naam, they are radiant and famous."
P0017L16,"They worship the Naam, and they believe in the Naam. The True One is forever Intact and Unbroken. ||3||"
P0017L17,"When the body mingles with dust, what happens to the soul?"
P0017L18,"All clever tricks are burnt away, and you shall depart crying."
P0017L19,"O Nanak, those who forget the Naam-what will happen when they go to the Court of the Lord? ||4||8||"
P0017L20,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0017L21,The virtuous wife exudes virtue; the unvirtuous suffer in misery.

P0017L24,My Lord and Master is Perfect; His Throne is Eternal and Immovable.
P0017L25,"One who attains perfection as Gurmukh, obtains the Immeasurable True Lord. ||1||Pause||"
P0017L26,The Palace of the Lord God is so beautiful.
P0017L27,"Within it, there are gems, rubies, pearls and flawless diamonds. A fortress of gold surrounds this Source of Nectar."
P0017L28,"How can I climb up to the Fortress without a ladder? By meditating on the Lord, through the Guru, I am blessed and exalted. ||2||"
P0017L29,"The Guru is the Ladder, the Guru is the Boat, and the Guru is the Raft to take me to the Lord's Name."
P0017L30,"The Guru is the Boat to carry me across the world-ocean; the Guru is the Sacred Shrine of Pilgrimage, the Guru is the Holy River."
P0017L31,"If it pleases Him, I bathe in the Pool of Truth, and become radiant and pure. ||3||"
P0017L32,He is called the Most Perfect of the Perfect. He sits upon His Perfect Throne.
P0017L33,He looks so Beautiful in His Perfect Place. He fulfills the hopes of the hopeless.

P0018L02,So many of Your beings and creatures praise You day and night.
P0018L03,"You have so many forms and colors, so many classes, high and low. ||3||"
P0018L04,"Meeting the True One, Truth wells up. The truthful are absorbed into the True Lord."
P0018L05,"Intuitive understanding is obtained and one is welcomed with honor, through the Guru's Word, filled with the Fear of God."

P0018L11,"O mind, meeting with the True One, fear departs."
P0018L12,"Without the Fear of God, how can anyone become fearless? Become Gurmukh, and immerse yourself in the Shabad. ||1||Pause||"
P0018L13,How can we describe Him with words? There is no end to the descriptions of Him.
P0018L14,"There are so many beggars, but He is the only Giver."
P0018L15,"He is the Giver of the soul, and the praanaa, the breath of life; when He dwells within the mind, there is peace. ||2||"
P0018L16,"The world is a drama, staged in a dream. In a moment, the play is played out."

P0018L28,"Upon that Highest Plane of Sublime Beauty, stands the Mansion of the Lord."
P0018L29,"By true actions, this human body is obtained, and the door within ourselves which leads to the Mansion of the Beloved, is found."
P0018L30,"The Gurmukhs train their minds to contemplate the Lord, the Supreme Soul. ||2||"
P0018L31,"By actions committed under the influence of the three qualities, hope and anxiety are produced."
P0018L32,"Without the Guru, how can anyone be released from these three qualities? Through intuitive wisdom, we meet with Him and find peace."
P0018L33,"Within the home of the self, the Mansion of His Presence is realized when He bestows His Glance of Grace and washes away our pollution. ||3||"
P0018L34,"Without the Guru, this pollution is not removed. Without the Lord, how can there be any homecoming?"
P0018L35,"Contemplate the One Word of the Shabad, and abandon other hopes."
P0018L36,"O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to the one who beholds, and inspires others to behold Him. ||4||12||"
P0018L37,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0018L38,The life of the discarded bride is cursed. She is deceived by the love of duality.
P0018L39,"Like a wall of sand, day and night, she crumbles, and eventually, she breaks down altogether."

P0018L41,"O soul-bride, without your Husband Lord, what good are your decorations?"
P0019L01,"In this world, you shall not find any shelter; in the world hereafter, being false, you shall suffer. ||1||Pause||"
P0019L02,The True Lord Himself knows all; He makes no mistakes. He is the Great Farmer of the Universe.
P0019L03,"First, He prepares the ground, and then He plants the Seed of the True Name."
P0019L04,"The nine treasures are produced from Name of the One Lord. By His Grace, we obtain His Banner and Insignia. ||2||"
P0019L05,"Some are very knowledgeable, but if they do not know the Guru, then what is the use of their lives?"
P0019L06,"The blind have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The self-willed manmukhs are in utter darkness."
P0019L07,"Their comings and goings in reincarnation do not end; through death and rebirth, they are wasting away. ||3||"
P0019L08,"The bride may buy sandalwood oil and perfumes, and apply them in great quantities to her hair;"
P0019L09,"She may sweeten her breath with betel leaf and camphor,"
P0019L10,"But if this bride is not pleasing to her Husband Lord, then all these trappings are false. ||4||"
P0019L11,"Her enjoyment of all pleasures is futile, and all her decorations are corrupt."
P0019L12,"Until she has been pierced through with the Shabad, how can she look beautiful at Guru's Gate?"
P0019L13,"O Nanak, blessed is that fortunate bride, who is in love with her Husband Lord. ||5||13||"

P0019L17,"The five relatives (the senses) weep and wail painfully, and waste away through the love of duality. ||1||"
P0019L18,"You fool: chant the Name of the Lord, and preserve your virtue."
P0019L19,Egotism and possessiveness are very enticing; egotistical pride has plundered everyone. ||1||Pause||
P0019L20,"Those who have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are attached to affairs of duality."
P0019L21,"Attached to duality, they putrefy and die; they are filled with the fire of desire within."
P0019L22,Those who are protected by the Guru are saved; all others are cheated and plundered by deceitful worldly affairs. ||2||
P0019L23,"Love dies, and affection vanishes. Hatred and alienation die."
P0019L24,"Entanglements end, and egotism dies, along with attachment to Maya, possessiveness and anger."
P0019L25,Those who receive His Mercy obtain the True One. The Gurmukhs dwell forever in balanced restraint. ||3||
P0019L26,"By true actions, the True Lord is met, and the Guru's Teachings are found."
P0019L27,"Then, they are not subject to birth and death; they do not come and go in reincarnation."
P0019L28,"O Nanak, they are respected at the Lord's Gate; they are robed in honor in the Court of the Lord. ||4||14||"
P0019L29,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0019L30,"The body is burnt to ashes; by its love of Maya, the mind is rusted through."
P0019L31,"Demerits become one's enemies, and falsehood blows the bugle of attack."
P0019L32,"Without the Word of the Shabad, people wander lost in reincarnation. Through the love of duality, multitudes have been drowned. ||1||"
P0019L33,"O mind, swim across, by focusing your consciousness on the Shabad."
P0019L34,"Those who do not become Gurmukh do not understand the Naam; they die, and continue coming and going in reincarnation. ||1||Pause||"
P0019L35,"That body is said to be pure, in which the True Name abides."
P0019L36,"One whose body is imbued with the Fear of the True One, and whose tongue savors Truthfulness,"
P0019L37,Is brought to ecstasy by the True Lord's Glance of Grace. That person does not have to go through the fire of the womb again. ||2||
P0019L38,"From the True Lord came the air, and from the air came water."
P0019L39,"From water, He created the three worlds; in each and every heart He has infused His Light."
P0019L40,"The Immaculate Lord does not become polluted. Attuned to the Shabad, honor is obtained. ||3||"
P0019L41,"One whose mind is contented with Truthfulness, is blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace."
P0020L01,The body of the five elements is dyed in the Fear of the True One; the mind is filled with the True Light.
P0020L02,"O Nanak, your demerits shall be forgotten; the Guru shall preserve your honor. ||4||15||"
P0020L03,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0020L04,"O Nanak, the Boat of Truth will ferry you across; contemplate the Guru."
P0020L05,"Some come, and some go; they are totally filled with egotism."
P0020L06,"Through stubborn-mindedness, the intellect is drowned; one who becomes Gurmukh and truthful is saved. ||1||"
P0020L07,"Without the Guru, how can anyone swim across to find peace?"
P0020L08,"As it pleases You, Lord, You save me. There is no other for me at all. ||1||Pause||"
P0020L09,"In front of me, I see the jungle burning; behind me, I see green plants sprouting."
P0020L10,We shall merge into the One from whom we came. The True One is pervading each and every heart.
P0020L11,He Himself unites us in Union with Himself; the True Mansion of His Presence is close at hand. ||2||
P0020L12,"With each and every breath, I dwell upon You; I shall never forget You."
P0020L13,"The more the Lord and Master dwells within the mind, the more the Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar."
P0020L14,"Mind and body are Yours; You are my Master. Please rid me of my pride, and let me merge with You. ||3||"
P0020L15,The One who formed this universe created the creation of the three worlds.
P0020L16,"The Gurmukh knows the Divine Light, while the foolish self-willed manmukh gropes around in the darkness."
P0020L17,One who sees that Light within each and every heart understands the Essence of the Guru's Teachings. ||4||
P0020L18,Those who understand are Gurmukh; recognize and applaud them.
P0020L19,They meet and merge with the True One. They become the Radiant Manifestation of the Excellence of the True One.
P0020L20,"O Nanak, they are contented with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. They offer their bodies and souls to God. ||5||16||"
P0020L21,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0020L22,"Listen, O my mind, my friend, my darling: now is the time to meet the Lord."
P0020L23,"As long as there is youth and breath, give this body to Him."
P0020L24,"Without virtue, it is useless; the body shall crumble into a pile of dust. ||1||"
P0020L25,"O my mind, earn the profit, before you return home."
P0020L26,"The Gurmukh praises the Naam, and the fire of egotism is extinguished. ||1||Pause||"
P0020L27,"Again and again, we hear and tell stories; we read and write and understand loads of knowledge,"
P0020L28,"But still, desires increase day and night, and the disease of egotism fills us with corruption."
P0020L29,That Carefree Lord cannot be appraised; His Real Value is known only through the Wisdom of the Guru's Teachings. ||2||
P0020L30,"Even if someone has hundreds of thousands of clever mental tricks, and the love and company of hundreds of thousands of people"
P0020L31,"Still, without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he will not feel satisfied. Without the Name, all suffer in sorrow."
P0020L32,"Chanting the Name of the Lord, O my soul, you shall be emancipated; as Gurmukh, you shall come to understand your own self. ||3||"
P0020L33,"I have sold my body and mind to the Guru, and I have given my mind and head as well."
P0020L34,"I was seeking and searching for Him throughout the three worlds; then, as Gurmukh, I sought and found Him."
P0020L35,"The True Guru has united me in Union, O Nanak, with that God. ||4||17||"
P0020L36,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0020L37,"I have no anxiety about dying, and no hope of living."
P0020L38,You are the Cherisher of all beings; You keep the account of our breaths and morsels of food.
P0020L39,"You abide within the Gurmukh. As it pleases You, You decide our allotment. ||1||"
P0020L40,"O my soul, chant the Name of the Lord; the mind will be pleased and appeased."
P0020L41,The raging fire within is extinguished; the Gurmukh obtains spiritual wisdom. ||1||Pause||
P0021L01,Know the state of your inner being; meet with the Guru and get rid of your skepticism.
P0021L02,"To reach your True Home after you die, you must conquer death while you are still alive."
P0021L03,"The beautiful, Unstruck Sound of the Shabad is obtained, contemplating the Guru. ||2||"
P0021L04,"The Unstruck Melody of Gurbani is obtained, and egotism is eliminated."
P0021L05,I am forever a sacrifice to those who serve their True Guru.
P0021L06,They are dressed in robes of honor in the Court of the Lord; the Name of the Lord is on their lips. ||3||
P0021L07,"Wherever I look, I see the Lord pervading there, in the union of Shiva and Shakti, of consciousness and matter."
P0021L08,The three qualities hold the body in bondage; whoever comes into the world is subject to their play.
P0021L09,Those who separate themselves from the Lord wander lost in misery. The self-willed manmukhs do not attain union with Him. ||4||
P0021L10,"If the mind becomes balanced and detached, and comes to dwell in its own true home, imbued with the Fear of God,"
P0021L11,Then it enjoys the essence of supreme spiritual wisdom; it shall never feel hunger again.
P0021L12,"O Nanak, conquer and subdue this mind; meet with the Lord, and you shall never again suffer in pain. ||5||18||"
P0021L13,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0021L14,"This foolish mind is greedy; through greed, it becomes even more attached to greed."
P0021L15,"The evil-minded shaaktas, the faithless cynics, are not attuned to the Shabad; they come and go in reincarnation."
P0021L16,One who meets with the Holy True Guru finds the Treasure of Excellence. ||1||
P0021L17,"O mind, renounce your egotistical pride."
P0021L18,"Serve the Lord, the Guru, the Sacred Pool, and you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. ||1||Pause||"
P0021L19,"Chant the Name of the Lord day and night; become Gurmukh, and know the Wealth of the Lord."
P0021L20,"All comforts and peace, and the Essence of the Lord, are enjoyed by acquiring spiritual wisdom in the Society of the Saints."
P0021L21,"Day and night, continually serve the Lord God; the True Guru has given the Naam. ||2||"
P0021L22,Those who practice falsehood are dogs; those who slander the Guru shall burn in their own fire.
P0021L23,"They wander lost and confused, deceived by doubt, suffering in terrible pain. The Messenger of Death shall beat them to a pulp."
P0021L24,"The self-willed manmukhs find no peace, while the Gurmukhs are wondrously joyful. ||3||"
P0021L25,"In this world, people are engrossed in false pursuits, but in the world hereafter, only the account of your true actions is accepted."
P0021L26,"The Guru serves the Lord, His Intimate Friend. The Guru's actions are supremely exalted."
P0021L27,"O Nanak, never forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the True Lord shall bless you with His Mark of Grace. ||4||19||"
P0021L28,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0021L29,"Forgetting the Beloved, even for a moment, the mind is afflicted with terrible diseases."
P0021L30,"How can honor be attained in His Court, if the Lord does not dwell in the mind?"
P0021L31,"Meeting with the Guru, peace is found. The fire is extinguished in His Glorious Praises. ||1||"
P0021L32,"O mind, enshrine the Praises of the Lord, day and night."
P0021L33,"One who does not forget the Naam, for a moment or even an instant-how rare is such a person in this world! ||1||Pause||"
P0021L34,"When one's light merges into the Light, and one's intuitive consciousness is joined with the Intuitive Consciousness,"
P0021L35,"Then one's cruel and violent instincts and egotism depart, and skepticism and sorrow are taken away."
P0021L36,"The Lord abides within the mind of the Gurmukh, who merges in the Lord's Union, through the Guru. ||2||"
P0021L37,"If I surrender my body like a bride, the Enjoyer will enjoy me."
P0021L38,Do not make love with one who is just a passing show.
P0021L39,"The Gurmukh is ravished like the pure and happy bride on the Bed of God, her Husband. ||3||"
P0022L01,"The Gurmukh puts out the four fires, with the Water of the Lord's Name."
P0022L02,"The lotus blossoms deep within the heart, and filled with Ambrosial Nectar, one is satisfied."
P0022L03,"O Nanak, make the True Guru your friend; going to His Court, you shall obtain the True Lord. ||4||20||"
P0022L04,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0022L05,"Meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, O my beloved; follow the Guru's Teachings, and speak of the Lord."
P0022L06,"Apply the Touchstone of Truth to your mind, and see if it comes up to its full weight."
P0022L07,No one has found the worth of the ruby of the heart; its value cannot be estimated. ||1||
P0022L08,"O Siblings of Destiny, the Diamond of the Lord is within the Guru."
P0022L09,"The True Guru is found in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Day and night, praise the Word of His Shabad. ||1||Pause||"
P0022L10,"The True Merchandise, Wealth and Capital are obtained through the Radiant Light of the Guru."
P0022L11,"Just as fire is extinguished by pouring on water, desire becomes the slave of the Lord's slaves."
P0022L12,"The Messenger of Death will not touch you; in this way, you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, carrying others across with you. ||2||"
P0022L13,The Gurmukhs do not like falsehood. They are imbued with Truth; they love only Truth.
P0022L14,"The shaaktas, the faithless cynics, do not like the Truth; false are the foundations of the false."
P0022L15,"Imbued with Truth, you shall meet the Guru. The true ones are absorbed into the True Lord. ||3||"
P0022L16,"Within the mind are emeralds and rubies, the Jewel of the Naam, treasures and diamonds."
P0022L17,"The Naam is the True Merchandise and Wealth; in each and every heart, His Presence is deep and profound."
P0022L18,"O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the Diamond of the Lord, by His Kindness and Compassion. ||4||21||"
P0022L19,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0022L20,"The fire of doubt is not extinguished, even by wandering through foreign lands and countries."
P0022L21,"If inner filth is not removed, one's life is cursed, and one's clothes are cursed."
P0022L22,"There is no other way to perform devotional worship, except through the Teachings of the True Guru. ||1||"
P0022L23,"O mind, become Gurmukh, and extinguish the fire within."
P0022L24,Let the Words of the Guru abide within your mind; let egotism and desires die. ||1||Pause||
P0022L25,"The jewel of the mind is priceless; through the Name of the Lord, honor is obtained."
P0022L26,"Join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and find the Lord. The Gurmukh embraces love for the Lord."
P0022L27,"Give up your selfishness, and you shall find peace; like water mingling with water, you shall merge in absorption. ||2||"
P0022L28,"Those who have not contemplated the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, are unworthy; they come and go in reincarnation."
P0022L29,"One who has not met with the True Guru, the Primal Being, is bothered and bewildered in the terrifying world-ocean."
P0022L30,"This jewel of the soul is priceless, and yet it is being squandered like this, in exchange for a mere shell. ||3||"
P0022L31,Those who joyfully meet with the True Guru are perfectly fulfilled and wise.
P0022L32,"Meeting with the Guru, they cross over the terrifying world-ocean. In the Court of the Lord, they are honored and approved."
P0022L33,"O Nanak, their faces are radiant; the Music of the Shabad, the Word of God, wells up within them. ||4||22||"
P0022L34,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0022L35,"Make your deals, dealers, and take care of your merchandise."
P0022L36,Buy that object which will go along with you.
P0022L37,"In the next world, the All-knowing Merchant will take this object and care for it. ||1||"
P0022L38,"O Siblings of Destiny, chant the Lord's Name, and focus your consciousness on Him."
P0022L39,Take the Merchandise of the Lord's Praises with you. Your Husband Lord shall see this and approve. ||1||Pause||
P0023L01,Those who do not have the Assets of Truth-how can they find peace?
P0023L02,"By dealing their deals of falsehood, their minds and bodies become false."
P0023L03,"Like the deer caught in the trap, they suffer in terrible agony; they continually cry out in pain. ||2||"
P0023L04,The counterfeit coins are not put into the Treasury; they do not obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord-Guru.
P0023L05,The false ones have no social status or honor. No one succeeds through falsehood.
P0023L06,"Practicing falsehood again and again, people come and go in reincarnation, and forfeit their honor. ||3||"
P0023L07,"O Nanak, instruct your mind through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and praise the Lord."
P0023L08,Those who are imbued with the love of the Name of the Lord are not loaded down by doubt.
P0023L09,Those who chant the Name of the Lord earn great profits; the Fearless Lord abides within their minds. ||4||23||
P0023L10,"Siree Raag, First Mehl, Second House:"
P0023L11,"Wealth, the beauty of youth and flowers are guests for only a few days."
P0023L12,"Like the leaves of the water-lily, they wither and fade and finally die. ||1||"
P0023L13,"Be happy, dear beloved, as long as your youth is fresh and delightful."
P0023L14,"But your days are few-you have grown weary, and now your body has grown old. ||1||Pause||"
P0023L15,My playful friends have gone to sleep in the graveyard.
P0023L16,"In my double-mindedness, I shall have to go as well. I cry in a feeble voice. ||2||"
P0023L17,"Haven't you heard the call from beyond, O beautiful soul-bride?"
P0023L18,You must go to your in-laws; you cannot stay with your parents forever. ||3||
P0023L19,"O Nanak, know that she who sleeps in her parents' home is plundered in broad daylight."
P0023L20,"She has lost her bouquet of merits; gathering one of demerits, she departs. ||4||24||"
P0023L21,"Siree Raag, First Mehl, Second House:"
P0023L22,"He Himself is the Enjoyer, and He Himself is the Enjoyment. He Himself is the Ravisher of all."
P0023L23,"He Himself is the Bride in her dress, He Himself is the Bridegroom on the bed. ||1||"
P0023L24,My Lord and Master is imbued with love; He is totally permeating and pervading all. ||1||Pause||
P0023L25,He Himself is the fisherman and the fish; He Himself is the water and the net.
P0023L26,"He Himself is the sinker, and He Himself is the bait. ||2||"
P0023L27,"He Himself loves in so many ways. O sister soul-brides, He is my Beloved."
P0023L28,He continually ravishes and enjoys the happy soul-brides; just look at the plight I am in without Him! ||3||
P0023L29,"Prays Nanak, please hear my prayer: You are the pool, and You are the soul-swan."
P0023L30,"You are the lotus flower of the day and You are the water-lily of the night. You Yourself behold them, and blossom forth in bliss. ||4||25||"
P0023L31,"Siree Raag, First Mehl, Third House:"
P0023L32,"Make this body the field, and plant the seed of good actions. Water it with the Name of the Lord, who holds all the world in His Hands."
P0023L33,"Let your mind be the farmer; the Lord shall sprout in your heart, and you shall attain the state of Nirvaanaa. ||1||"
P0023L34,You fool! Why are you so proud of Maya?
P0023L35,"Father, children, spouse, mother and all relatives-they shall not be your helpers in the end. ||Pause||"
P0023L36,"So weed out evil, wickedness and corruption; leave these behind, and let your soul meditate on God."
P0023L37,"When chanting, austere meditation and self-discipline become your protectors, then the lotus blossoms forth, and the honey trickles out. ||2||"
P0023L38,"Bring the twenty-seven elements of the body under your control, and throughout the three stages of life, remember death."
P0023L39,"See the Infinite Lord in the ten directions, and in all the variety of nature. Says Nanak, in this way, the One Lord shall carry you across. ||3||26||"
P0024L01,"Siree Raag, First Mehl, Third House:"
P0024L02,"Make good deeds the soil, and let the Word of the Shabad be the seed; irrigate it continually with the water of Truth."
P0024L03,"Become such a farmer, and faith will sprout. This brings knowledge of heaven and hell, you fool! ||1||"
P0024L04,Do not think that your Husband Lord can be obtained by mere words.
P0024L05,You are wasting this life in the pride of wealth and the splendor of beauty. ||1||Pause||
P0024L06,"The defect of the body which leads to sin is the mud puddle, and this mind is the frog, which does not appreciate the lotus flower at all."
P0024L07,"The bumble bee is the teacher who continually teaches the lesson. But how can one understand, unless one is made to understand? ||2||"
P0024L08,"This speaking and listening is like the song of the wind, for those whose minds are colored by the love of Maya."
P0024L09,The Grace of the Master is bestowed upon those who meditate on Him alone. They are pleasing to His Heart. ||3||
P0024L10,"You may observe the thirty fasts, and say the five prayers each day, but 'Satan' can undo them."
P0024L11,"Says Nanak, you will have to walk on the Path of Death, so why do you bother to collect wealth and property? ||4||27||"
P0024L12,"Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:"
P0024L13,"He is the Master who has made the world bloom; He makes the Universe blossom forth, fresh and green."
P0024L14,He holds the water and the land in bondage. Hail to the Creator Lord! ||1||
P0024L15,"Death, O Mullah-death will come,"
P0024L16,So live in the Fear of God the Creator. ||1||Pause||
P0024L17,"You are a Mullah, and you are a Qazi, only when you know the Naam, the Name of God."
P0024L18,"You may be very educated, but no one can remain when the measure of life is full. ||2||"
P0024L19,"He alone is a Qazi, who renounces selfishness and conceit, and makes the One Name his Support."
P0024L20,"The True Creator Lord is, and shall always be. He was not born; He shall not die. ||3||"
P0024L21,You may chant your prayers five times each day; you may read the Bible and the Koran.
P0024L22,"Says Nanak, the grave is calling you, and now your food and drink are finished. ||4||28||"
P0024L23,"Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:"
P0024L24,The dogs of greed are with me.
P0024L25,"In the early morning, they continually bark at the wind."
P0024L26,"Falsehood is my dagger; through deception, I eat the carcasses of the dead."
P0024L27,"I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! ||1||"
P0024L28,"I have not followed good advice, nor have I done good deeds."
P0024L29,I am deformed and horribly disfigured.
P0024L30,"Your Name alone, Lord, saves the world."
P0024L31,This is my hope; this is my support. ||1||Pause||
P0024L32,"With my mouth I speak slander, day and night."
P0024L33,I spy on the houses of others-I am such a wretched low-life!
P0024L34,"Unfulfilled sexual desire and unresolved anger dwell in my body, like the outcasts who cremate the dead."
P0024L35,"I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! ||2||"
P0024L36,"I make plans to trap others, although I appear gentle."
P0024L37,I am a robber-I rob the world.
P0024L38,I am very clever-I carry loads of sin.
P0024L39,"I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! ||3||"
P0024L40,"I have not appreciated what You have done for me, Lord; I take from others and exploit them."
P0024L41,"What face shall I show You, Lord? I am a sneak and a thief."
P0024L42,Nanak describes the state of the lowly.
P0024L43,"I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! ||4||29||"
P0024L44,"Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:"
P0024L45,There is one awareness among all created beings.
P0024L46,None have been created without this awareness.
P0025L01,"As is their awareness, so is their way."
P0025L02,"According to the account of our actions, we come and go in reincarnation. ||1||"
P0025L03,"Why, O soul, do you try such clever tricks?"
P0025L04,"Taking away and giving back, God does not delay. ||1||Pause||"
P0025L05,"All beings belong to You; all beings are Yours. O Lord and Master,"
P0025L06,How can You become angry with them?
P0025L07,"Even if You, O Lord and Master, become angry with them,"
P0025L08,"Still, You are theirs, and they are Yours. ||2||"
P0025L09,We are foul-mouthed; we spoil everything with our foul words.
P0025L10,You weigh us in the balance of Your Glance of Grace.
P0025L11,"When one's actions are right, the understanding is perfect."
P0025L12,"Without good deeds, it becomes more and more deficient. ||3||"
P0025L13,"Prays Nanak, what is the nature of the spiritual people?"
P0025L14,They are self-realized; they understand God.
P0025L15,"By Guru's Grace, they contemplate Him;"
P0025L16,Such spiritual people are honored in His Court. ||4||30||
P0025L17,"Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:"
P0025L18,"You are the River, All-knowing and All-seeing. I am just a fish-how can I find Your limit?"
P0025L19,"Wherever I look, You are there. Outside of You, I would burst and die. ||1||"
P0025L20,"I do not know of the fisherman, and I do not know of the net."
P0025L21,"But when the pain comes, then I call upon You. ||1||Pause||"
P0025L22,You are present everywhere. I had thought that You were far away.
P0025L23,"Whatever I do, I do in Your Presence."
P0025L24,"You see all my actions, and yet I deny them."
P0025L25,"I have not worked for You, or Your Name. ||2||"
P0025L26,"Whatever You give me, that is what I eat."
P0025L27,There is no other door-unto which door should I go?
P0025L28,Nanak offers this one prayer:
P0025L29,This body and soul are totally Yours. ||3||
P0025L30,"He Himself is near, and He Himself is far away; He Himself is in-between."
P0025L31,"He Himself beholds, and He Himself listens. By His Creative Power, He created the world."
P0025L32,"Whatever pleases Him, O Nanak-that Command is acceptable. ||4||31||"
P0025L33,"Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:"
P0025L34,Why should the created beings feel pride in their minds?
P0025L35,The Gift is in the Hands of the Great Giver.
P0025L36,"As it pleases Him, He may give, or not give."
P0025L37,What can be done by the order of the created beings? ||1||
P0025L38,He Himself is True; Truth is pleasing to His Will.
P0025L39,"The spiritually blind are unripe and imperfect, inferior and worthless. ||1||Pause||"
P0025L40,The One who owns the trees of the forest and the plants of the garden
P0025L41,"According to their nature, He gives them all their names."
P0025L42,The Flower and the Fruit of the Lord's Love are obtained by pre-ordained destiny.
P0025L43,"As we plant, so we harvest and eat. ||2||"
P0025L44,"The wall of the body is temporary, as is the soul-mason within it."
P0025L45,The flavor of the intellect is bland and insipid without the Salt.
P0025L46,"O Nanak, as He wills, He makes things right."
P0025L47,"Without the Name, no one is approved. ||3||32||"
P0025L48,"Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fifth House:"
P0025L49,The Undeceiveable is not deceived by deception. He cannot be wounded by any dagger.
P0025L50,"As our Lord and Master keeps us, so do we exist. The soul of this greedy person is tossed this way and that. ||1||"
P0025L51,"Without the oil, how can the lamp be lit? ||1||Pause||"
P0025L52,"Let the reading of your prayer book be the oil,"
P0025L53,And let the Fear of God be the wick for the lamp of this body.
P0025L54,Light this lamp with the understanding of Truth. ||2||
P0025L55,Use this oil to light this lamp.
P0025L56,"Light it, and meet your Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||"
P0025L57,This body is softened with the Word of the Guru's Bani;
P0025L58,"You shall find peace, doing seva (selfless service)."
P0026L01,All the world continues coming and going in reincarnation. ||3||
P0026L02,"In the midst of this world, do seva,"
P0026L03,And you shall be given a place of honor in the Court of the Lord.
P0026L04,"Says Nanak, swing your arms in joy! ||4||33||"
P0026L05,"Siree Raag, Third Mehl, First House:"
P0026L06,One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
P0026L07,"I serve my True Guru with single-minded devotion, and lovingly focus my consciousness on Him."
P0026L08,"The True Guru is the mind's desire and the sacred shrine of pilgrimage, for those unto whom He has given this understanding."
P0026L09,"The blessings of the wishes of the mind are obtained, and the fruits of one's desires."
P0026L10,"Meditate on the Name, worship the Name, and through the Name, you shall be absorbed in intuitive peace and poise. ||1||"
P0026L11,"O my mind, drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and your thirst shall be quenched."
P0026L12,Those Gurmukhs who have tasted it remain intuitively absorbed in the Lord. ||1||Pause||
P0026L13,Those who serve the True Guru obtain the Treasure of the Naam.
P0026L14,"Deep within, they are drenched with the Essence of the Lord, and the egotistical pride of the mind is subdued."
P0026L15,"The heart-lotus blossoms forth, and they intuitively center themselves in meditation."
P0026L16,"Their minds become pure, and they remain immersed in the Lord; they are honored in His Court. ||2||"
P0026L17,Those who serve the True Guru in this world are very rare.
P0026L18,Those who keep the Lord enshrined in their hearts subdue egotism and possessiveness.
P0026L19,I am a sacrifice to those who are in love with the Naam.
P0026L20,Those who attain the Inexhaustible Name of the Infinite Lord remain happy throughout the four ages. ||3||
P0026L21,"Meeting with the Guru, the Naam is obtained, and the thirst of emotional attachment departs."
P0026L22,"When the mind is permeated with the Lord, one remains detached within the home of the heart."
P0026L23,I am a sacrifice to those who enjoy the Sublime Taste of the Lord.
P0026L24,"O Nanak, by His Glance of Grace, the True Name, the Treasure of Excellence, is obtained. ||4||1||34||"
P0026L25,"Siree Raag, Third Mehl:"
P0026L26,"People wear all sorts of costumes and wander all around, but in their hearts and minds, they practice deception."
P0026L27,"They do not attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and after death, they sink into manure. ||1||"
P0026L28,"O mind, remain detached in the midst of your household."
P0026L29,"Practicing truth, self-discipline and good deeds, the Gurmukh is enlightened. ||1||Pause||"
P0026L30,"Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the mind is conquered, and one attains the State of Liberation in one's own home."
P0026L31,"So meditate on the Name of the Lord; join and merge with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. ||2||"
P0026L32,"You may enjoy the pleasures of hundreds of thousands of women, and rule the nine continents of the world."
P0026L33,"But without the True Guru, you will not find peace; you will be reincarnated over and over again. ||3||"
P0026L34,"Those who wear the Necklace of the Lord around their necks, and focus their consciousness on the Guru's Feet"
P0026L35,"-wealth and supernatural spiritual powers follow them, but they do not care for such things at all. ||4||"
P0026L36,Whatever pleases God's Will comes to pass. Nothing else can be done.
P0026L37,"Servant Nanak lives by chanting the Naam. O Lord, please give it to me, in Your Natural Way. ||5||2||35||"
P0027L01,"Siree Raag, Third Mehl, First House:"
P0027L02,Everyone belongs to the One who rules the Universe.
P0027L03,"The Gurmukh practices good deeds, and the truth is revealed in the heart."
P0027L04,"True is the reputation of the true, within whom truth abides."
P0027L05,Those who meet the True Lord are not separated again; they come to dwell in the home of the self deep within. ||1||
P0027L06,"O my Lord! Without the Lord, I have no other at all."
P0027L07,The True Guru leads us to meet the Immaculate True God through the Word of His Shabad. ||1||Pause||
P0027L08,"One whom the Lord merges into Himself is merged in the Shabad, and remains so merged."
P0027L09,"No one merges with Him through the love of duality; over and over again, they come and go in reincarnation."

P0040L12,The Naam is a Priceless Jewel; it is with the Perfect True Guru.
P0040L13,"When one is enjoined to serve the True Guru, He brings out this Jewel and bestows this enlightenment."
P0040L14,"Blessed, and most fortunate of the very fortunate, are those who come to meet the Guru. ||2||"
P0040L15,"Those who have not met the Primal Being, the True Guru, are most unfortunate, and are subject to death."
P0040L16,"They wander in reincarnation over and over again, as the most disgusting maggots in manure."
P0040L17,"Do not meet with, or even approach those people, whose hearts are filled with horrible anger. ||3||"
P0040L18,"The True Guru, the Primal Being, is the Pool of Ambrosial Nectar. The very fortunate ones come to bathe in it."

P0040L23,"The Gurmukhs, my spiritual friends, bestow virtue. Meeting with my spiritual friends, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord."
P0040L24,"The Diamond of the Guru has pierced the diamond of my mind, which is now dyed in the deep crimson color of the Name. ||1||"
P0040L25,"O my Lord of the Universe, singing Your Glorious Praises, my mind is satisfied."
P0040L26,"Within me is the thirst for the Lord's Name; may the Guru, in His Pleasure, grant it to me. ||1||Pause||"
P0040L27,"Let your minds be imbued with His Love, O blessed and fortunate ones. By His Pleasure, the Guru bestows His Gifts."
P0040L28,"The Guru has lovingly implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me; I am a sacrifice to the True Guru."
P0040L29,"Without the True Guru, the Name of the Lord is not found, even though people may perform hundreds of thousands, even millions of rituals. ||2||"
P0040L30,"Without destiny, the True Guru is not found, even though He sits within the home of our own inner being, always near and close at hand."
P0040L31,"There is ignorance within, and the pain of doubt, like a separating screen."
P0040L32,"Without meeting with the True Guru, no one is transformed into gold. The self-willed manmukh sinks like iron, while the boat is very close. ||3||"
P0040L33,The Boat of the True Guru is the Name of the Lord. How can we climb on board?
P0040L34,One who walks in harmony with the True Guru's Will comes to sit in this Boat.

P0041L01,"Siree Raag, Forth Mehl:"
P0041L02,I stand by the wayside and ask the Way. If only someone would show me the Way to God-I would go with him.

P0041L04,"I beg of them, I implore them; I have such a yearning to meet God! ||1||"
P0041L05,"O my Siblings of Destiny, please unite me in Union with my Lord God."
P0041L06,"I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who has shown me the Lord God. ||1||Pause||"
P0041L07,"In deep humility, I fall at the Feet of the Perfect True Guru."
P0041L08,"The Guru is the Honor of the dishonored. The Guru, the True Guru, brings approval and applause."
P0041L09,"I am never tired of praising the Guru, who unites me with the Lord God. ||2||"
P0041L10,"Everyone, all over the world, longs for the True Guru."

P0041L15,"Over all the world, He is the Life of the World, O Nanak, like water mingled with water. ||4||4||68||"
P0041L16,"Siree Raag, Forth Mehl:"
P0041L17,The Essence of the Ambrosial Naam is the most sublime essence; how can I get to taste this essence?
P0041L18,"I go and ask the happy soul-brides, """"How did you come to meet God?"""""
P0041L19,They are care-free and do not speak; I massage and wash their feet. ||1||
P0041L20,"O Siblings of Destiny, meet with your spiritual friend, and dwell upon the Glorious Praises of the Lord."
P0041L21,"The True Guru, the Primal Being, is your Friend, who shall drive out pain and subdue your ego. ||1||Pause||"
P0041L22,The Gurmukhs are the happy soul-brides; their minds are filled with kindness.
P0041L23,The Word of the True Guru is the Jewel. One who believes in it tastes the Sublime Essence of the Lord.
P0041L24,"Those who partake of the Lord's Sublime Essence, through the Guru's Love, are known as great and very fortunate. ||2||"
P0041L25,"This Sublime Essence of the Lord is in the forests, in the fields and everywhere, but the unfortunate ones do not taste it."
P0041L26,"Without the True Guru, it is not obtained. The self-willed manmukhs continue to cry in misery."
P0041L27,They do not bow before the True Guru; the demon of anger is within them. ||3||
P0041L28,"The Lord Himself, Har, Har, Har, is the Sublime Essence. The Lord Himself is the Essence."

P0041L30,"Then, the body and mind totally blossom forth and flourish; O Nanak, the Lord comes to dwell within the mind. ||4||5||69||"
P0041L31,"Siree Raag, Forth Mehl:"
P0041L32,"The day dawns, and then it ends, and the night passes away."
P0041L33,"Man's life is diminishing, but he does not understand. Each day, the mouse of death is gnawing away at the rope of life."
P0041L34,"Maya spreads out like sweet molasses; the self-willed manmukh is stuck like a fly, rotting away. ||1||"
P0041L35,"O Siblings of Destiny, God is my Friend and Companion."
P0041L36,"Emotional attachment to children and spouse is poison; in the end, no one will go along with you as your helper. ||1||Pause||"
P0041L37,"Through the Guru's Teachings, some embrace love for the Lord, and are saved. They remain detached and unaffected, and they find the Sanctuary of the Lord."
P0042L01,"They keep death constantly before their eyes; they gather the Provisions of the Lord's Name, and receive honor."
P0042L02,The Gurmukhs are honored in the Court of the Lord. The Lord Himself takes them in His Loving Embrace. ||2||
P0042L03,"For the Gurmukhs, the Way is obvious. At the Lord's Door, they face no obstructions."
P0042L04,"They praise the Lord's Name, they keep the Naam in their minds, and they remain attached to the Love of the Naam."
P0042L05,"The Unstruck Celestial Music vibrates for them at the Lord's Door, and they are honored at the True Door. ||3||"
P0042L06,Those Gurmukhs who praise the Naam are applauded by everyone.
P0042L07,"Grant me their company, God-I am a beggar; this is my prayer."
P0042L08,"O Nanak, great is the good fortune of those Gurmukhs, who are filled with the Light of the Naam within. ||4||33||31||6||70||"
P0042L09,"Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:"
P0042L10,Why are you so thrilled by the sight of your son and your beautifully decorated wife?
P0042L11,"You enjoy tasty delicacies, you have lots of fun, and you indulge in endless pleasures."
P0042L12,"You give all sorts of commands, and you act so superior."
P0042L13,"The Creator does not come into the mind of the blind, idiotic, self-willed manmukh. ||1||"
P0042L14,"O my mind, the Lord is the Giver of peace."
P0042L15,"By Guru's Grace, He is found. By His Mercy, He is obtained. ||1||Pause||"
P0042L16,"People are entangled in the enjoyment of fine clothes, but gold and silver are only dust."
P0042L17,"They acquire beautiful horses and elephants, and ornate carriages of many kinds."
P0042L18,"They think of nothing else, and they forget all their relatives."
P0042L19,"They ignore their Creator; without the Name, they are impure. ||2||"
P0042L20,"Gathering the wealth of Maya, you earn an evil reputation."
P0042L21,Those whom you work to please shall pass away along with you.
P0042L22,"The egotistical are engrossed in egotism, ensnared by the intellect of the mind."
P0042L23,"One who is deceived by God Himself, has no position and no honor. ||3||"
P0042L24,"The True Guru, the Primal Being, has led me to meet the One, my only Friend."
P0042L25,The One is the Saving Grace of His humble servant. Why should the proud cry out in ego?
P0042L26,"As the servant of the Lord wills, so does the Lord act. At the Lord's Door, none of his requests are denied."
P0042L27,"Nanak is attuned to the Love of the Lord, whose Light pervades the entire Universe. ||4||1||71||"
P0042L28,"Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:"
P0042L29,"With the mind caught up in playful pleasures, involved in all sorts of amusements and sights that stagger the eyes, people are led astray."
P0042L30,The emperors sitting on their thrones are consumed by anxiety. ||1||
P0042L31,"O Siblings of Destiny, peace is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy."
P0042L32,"If the Supreme Lord, the Architect of Destiny, writes such an order, then anguish and anxiety are erased. ||1||Pause||"
P0042L33,There are so many places-I have wandered through them all.
P0042L34,"The masters of wealth and the great land-lords have fallen, crying out, """"This is mine! This is mine!""""||2||"
P0042L35,"They issue their commands fearlessly, and act in pride."
P0042L36,"They subdue all under their command, but without the Name, they are reduced to dust. ||3||"
P0042L37,"Even those who are served by the 33 million angelic beings, at whose door the Siddhas and the Saadhus stand,"
P0042L38,"Who live in wondrous affluence and rule over mountains, oceans and vast dominions-O Nanak, in the end, all this vanishes like a dream! ||4||2||72||"
P0043L01,"Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:"
P0043L02,"Arising each day, you cherish your body, but you are idiotic, ignorant and without understanding."
P0043L03,"You are not conscious of God, and your body shall be cast into the wilderness."
P0043L04,Focus your consciousness on the True Guru; you shall enjoy bliss forever and ever. ||1||
P0043L05,"O mortal, you came here to earn a profit."
P0043L06,What useless activities are you attached to? Your life-night is coming to its end. ||1||Pause||
P0043L07,The animals and the birds frolic and play-they do not see death.
P0043L08,"Mankind is also with them, trapped in the net of Maya."
P0043L09,"Those who always remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are considered to be liberated. ||2||"
P0043L10,That dwelling which you will have to abandon and vacate-you are attached to it in your mind.
P0043L11,And that place where you must go to dwell-you have no regard for it at all.
P0043L12,Those who fall at the Feet of the Guru are released from this bondage. ||3||
P0043L13,No one else can save you-don't look for anyone else.
P0043L14,I have searched in all four directions; I have come to find His Sanctuary.
P0043L15,"O Nanak, the True King has pulled me out and saved me from drowning! ||4||3||73||"
P0043L16,"Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:"
P0043L17,"For a brief moment, man is a guest of the Lord; he tries to resolve his affairs."
P0043L18,"Engrossed in Maya and sexual desire, the fool does not understand."
P0043L19,"He arises and departs with regret, and falls into the clutches of the Messenger of Death. ||1||"
P0043L20,You are sitting on the collapsing riverbank-are you blind?
P0043L21,"If you are so pre-destined, then act according to the Guru's Teachings. ||1||Pause||"
P0043L22,"The Reaper does not look upon any as unripe, half-ripe or fully ripe."
P0043L23,"Picking up and wielding their sickles, the harvesters arrive."
P0043L24,"When the landlord gives the order, they cut and measure the crop. ||2||"
P0043L25,"The first watch of the night passes away in worthless affairs, and the second passes in deep sleep."
P0043L26,"In the third, they babble nonsense, and when the fourth watch comes, the day of death has arrived."
P0043L27,The thought of the One who bestows body and soul never enters the mind. ||3||
P0043L28,"I am devoted to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; I sacrifice my soul to them."
P0043L29,"Through them, understanding has entered my mind, and I have met the All-knowing Lord God."
P0043L30,"Nanak sees the Lord always with him-the Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||4||4||74||"

P0044L01,"The opportunity to work hard serving the Saadh Sangat is obtained, when the Divine Lord is pleased."
P0044L02,Everything is in the Hands of our Lord and Master; He Himself is the Doer of deeds.
P0044L03,"I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who fulfills all hopes and desires. ||3||"
P0044L04,The One appears to be my Companion; the One is my Brother and Friend.
P0044L05,The elements and the components are all made by the One; they are held in their order by the One.
P0044L06,"When the mind accepts, and is satisfied with the One, then the consciousness becomes steady and stable."
P0044L07,"Then, one's food is the True Name, one's garments are the True Name, and one's Support, O Nanak, is the True Name. ||4||5||75||"

P0044L14,"Hundreds of thousands of princely pleasures are enjoyed, if the True Guru bestows His Glance of Grace."
P0044L15,"If He bestows the Name of the Lord, for even a moment, my mind and body are cooled and soothed."
P0044L16,Those who have such pre-ordained destiny hold tight to the Feet of the True Guru. ||2||

P0053L18,"Sacred is His Name, and Sacred is His Place. He is the True Cherisher. ||1||Pause||"
P0053L19,The extent of Your Command cannot be seen; no one knows how to write it.
P0053L20,"Even if a hundred poets met together, they could not describe even a tiny bit of it."
P0053L21,No one has found Your Value; they all merely write what they have heard again and again. ||2||
P0053L22,"The Pirs, the Prophets, the spiritual teachers, the faithful, the innocents and the martyrs,"
P0053L23,"The Shaikhs, the mystics, the Qazis, the Mullahs and the Dervishes at His Door"
P0053L24,-they are blessed all the more as they continue reading their prayers in praise to Him. ||3||
P0053L25,He seeks no advice when He builds; He seeks no advice when He destroys. He seeks no advice while giving or taking.
P0053L26,He alone knows His Creative Power; He Himself does all deeds.
P0053L27,He beholds all in His Vision. He gives to those with whom He is pleased. ||4||
P0053L28,"His Place and His Name are not known, no one knows how great is His Name."
P0053L29,How great is that place where my Sovereign Lord dwells?
P0053L30,No one can reach it; whom shall I go and ask? ||5||
P0053L31,"One class of people does not like the other, when one has been made great."
P0053L32,Greatness is only in His Great Hands; He gives to those with whom He is pleased.
P0053L33,"By the Hukam of His Command, He Himself regenerates, without a moment's delay. ||6||"
P0053L34,"Everyone cries out, """"More! More!"""", with the idea of receiving."
P0053L35,How great should we call the Giver? His Gifts are beyond estimation.
P0053L36,"O Nanak, there is no deficiency; Your Storehouses are filled to overflowing, age after age. ||7||1||"
P0053L37,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0053L38,All are brides of the Husband Lord; all decorate themselves for Him.
P0054L01,"But when the time comes to settle their accounts, their red robes are corrupt."
P0054L02,His Love is not obtained through hypocrisy. Her false coverings bring only ruin. ||1||
P0054L03,"In this way, the Dear Husband Lord ravishes and enjoys His bride."
P0054L04,"The happy soul-bride is pleasing to You, Lord; by Your Grace, You adorn her. ||1||Pause||"
P0054L05,She is decorated with the Word of the Guru's Shabad; her mind and body belong to her Husband Lord.
P0054L06,"With her palms pressed together, she stands, waiting on Him, and offers her True prayers to Him."
P0054L07,"Dyed in the deep crimson of the Love of her Darling Lord, she dwells in the Fear of the True One. Imbued with His Love, she is dyed in the color of His Love. ||2||"
P0054L08,She is said to be the hand-maiden of her Beloved Lord; His sweetheart surrenders to His Name.
P0054L09,True Love is never broken; she is united in Union with the True One.
P0054L10,"Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, her mind is pierced through. I am forever a sacrifice to Him. ||3||"
P0054L11,"That bride, who is absorbed into the True Guru, shall never become a widow."
P0054L12,"Her Husband Lord is Beautiful; His Body is forever fresh and new. The True One does not die, and shall not go."
P0054L13,"He continually enjoys His happy soul-bride; He casts His Gracious Glance of Truth upon her, and she abides in His Will. ||4||"
P0054L14,The bride braids her hair with Truth; her clothes are decorated with His Love.
P0054L15,"Like the essence of sandalwood, He permeates her consciousness, and the Temple of the Tenth Gate is opened."
P0054L16,"The lamp of the Shabad is lit, and the Name of the Lord is her necklace. ||5||"
P0054L17,She is the most beautiful among women; upon her forehead she wears the Jewel of the Lord's Love.
P0054L18,Her glory and her wisdom are magnificent; her love for the Infinite Lord is True.
P0054L19,"Other than her Beloved Lord, she knows no man. She enshrines love for the True Guru. ||6||"
P0054L20,"Asleep in the darkness of the night, how shall she pass her life-night without her Husband?"
P0054L21,"Her limbs shall burn, her body shall burn, and her mind and wealth shall burn as well."
P0054L22,"When the Husband does not enjoy His bride, then her youth passes away in vain. ||7||"
P0054L23,"The Husband is on the Bed, but the bride is asleep, and so she does not come to know Him."
P0054L24,"While I am asleep, my Husband Lord is awake. Where can I go for advice?"
P0054L25,"The True Guru has led me to meet Him, and now I dwell in the Fear of God. O Nanak, His Love is always with me. ||8||2||"
P0054L26,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0054L27,"O Lord, You are Your Own Glorious Praise. You Yourself speak it; You Yourself hear it and contemplate it."
P0054L28,"You Yourself are the Jewel, and You are the Appraiser. You Yourself are of Infinite Value."
P0054L29,"O True Lord, You are Honor and Glory; You Yourself are the Giver. ||1||"
P0054L30,"O Dear Lord, You are the Creator and the Cause."
P0054L31,"If it is Your Will, please save and protect me; please bless me with the lifestyle of the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||"
P0054L32,You Yourself are the flawless diamond; You Yourself are the deep crimson color.
P0054L33,You Yourself are the perfect pearl; You Yourself are the devotee and the priest.
P0054L34,"Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, You are praised. In each and every heart, the Unseen is seen. ||2||"
P0054L35,"You Yourself are the ocean and the boat. You Yourself are this shore, and the one beyond."
P0054L36,"O All-knowing Lord, You are the True Way. The Shabad is the Navigator to ferry us across."
P0054L37,"One who does not fear God shall live in fear; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness. ||3||"
P0054L38,The Creator alone is seen to be Eternal; all others come and go.
P0054L39,"Only You, Lord, are Immaculate and Pure. All others are bound up in worldly pursuits."
P0054L40,Those who are protected by the Guru are saved. They are lovingly attuned to the True Lord. ||4||
P0055L01,"Through the Shabad, they recognize the Dear Lord; through the Guru's Word, they are attuned to Truth."
P0055L02,Filth does not stick to the body of one who has secured a dwelling in his True Home.
P0055L03,"When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, we obtain the True Name. Without the Name, who are our relatives? ||5||"
P0055L04,Those who have realized the Truth are at peace throughout the four ages.
P0055L05,"Subduing their egotism and desires, they keep the True Name enshrined in their hearts."
P0055L06,"In this world, the only real profit is the Name of the One Lord; it is earned by contemplating the Guru. ||6||"
P0055L07,"Loading the Merchandise of the True Name, you shall gather in your profits forever with the Capital of Truth."
P0055L08,"In the Court of the True One, you shall sit in truthful devotion and prayer."
P0055L09,"Your account shall be settled with honor, in the Radiant Light of the Name of the Lord. ||7||"
P0055L10,The Lord is said to be the Highest of the High; no one can perceive Him.
P0055L11,"Wherever I look, I see only You. The True Guru has inspired me to see You."
P0055L12,"The Divine Light within is revealed, O Nanak, through this intuitive understanding. ||8||3||"
P0055L13,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0055L14,The fish did not notice the net in the deep and salty sea.
P0055L15,"It was so clever and beautiful, but why was it so confident?"
P0055L16,"By its actions it was caught, and now death cannot be turned away from its head. ||1||"
P0055L17,"O Siblings of Destiny, just like this, see death hovering over your own heads!"
P0055L18,"People are just like this fish; unaware, the noose of death descends upon them. ||1||Pause||"
P0055L19,"The whole world is bound by death; without the Guru, death cannot be avoided."
P0055L20,Those who are attuned to Truth are saved; they renounce duality and corruption.
P0055L21,I am a sacrifice to those who are found to be Truthful in the True Court. ||2||
P0055L22,"Think of the hawk preying on the birds, and the net in the hands of the hunter."
P0055L23,Those who are protected by the Guru are saved; the others are caught by the bait.
P0055L24,"Without the Name, they are picked up and thrown away; they have no friends or companions. ||3||"
P0055L25,God is said to be the Truest of the True; His Place is the Truest of the True.
P0055L26,Those who obey the True One-their minds abide in true meditation.
P0055L27,"Those who become Gurmukh, and obtain spiritual wisdom-their minds and mouths are known to be pure. ||4||"
P0055L28,"Offer your most sincere prayers to the True Guru, so that He may unite you with your Best Friend."
P0055L29,"Meeting your Best Friend, you shall find peace; the Messenger of Death shall take poison and die."
P0055L30,I dwell deep within the Name; the Name has come to dwell within my mind. ||5||
P0055L31,"Without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness; without the Shabad, understanding is not obtained."
P0055L32,"Through the Guru's Teachings, you shall be enlightened; remain absorbed in the Love of the True Lord."
P0055L33,Death does not go there; your light shall merge with the Light. ||6||
P0055L34,You are my Best Friend; You are All-knowing. You are the One who unites us with Yourself.
P0055L35,"Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, we praise You; You have no end or limitation."
P0055L36,"Death does not reach that place, where the Infinite Word of the Guru's Shabad resounds. ||7||"
P0055L37,"By the Hukam of His Command, all are created. By His Command, actions are performed."
P0055L38,"By His Command, all are subject to death; by His Command, they merge in Truth."
P0055L39,"O Nanak, whatever pleases His Will comes to pass. Nothing is in the hands of these beings. ||8||4||"
P0055L40,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0055L41,"If the mind is polluted, then the body is polluted, and the tongue is polluted as well."
P0056L01,"With false mouths, people speak falsehood. How can they be made pure?"
P0056L02,"Without the Holy Water of the Shabad, they are not cleansed. From the True One alone comes Truth. ||1||"
P0056L03,"O soul-bride, without virtue, what happiness can there be?"
P0056L04,The Husband Lord enjoys her with pleasure and delight; she is at peace in the love of the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
P0056L05,"When the Husband goes away, the bride suffers in the pain of separation,"
P0056L06,"Like the fish in shallow water, crying for mercy."
P0056L07,"As it pleases the Will of the Husband Lord, peace is obtained, when He Himself casts His Glance of Grace. ||2||"
P0056L08,"Praise your Husband Lord, together with your bridesmaids and friends."
P0056L09,"The body is beautified, and the mind is fascinated. Imbued with His Love, we are enraptured."
P0056L10,"Adorned with the Shabad, the beautiful bride enjoys her Husband with virtue. ||3||"
P0056L11,"The soul-bride is of no use at all, if she is evil and without virtue."
P0056L12,She does not find peace in this world or the next; she burns in falsehood and corruption.
P0056L13,Coming and going are very difficult for that bride who is abandoned and forgotten by her Husband Lord. ||4||
P0056L14,The beautiful soul-bride of the Husband Lord-by what sensual pleasures has she been doomed?
P0056L15,She is of no use to her Husband if she babbles in useless arguments.
P0056L16,"At the Door of His Home, she finds no shelter; she is discarded for seeking other pleasures. ||5||"
P0056L17,"The Pandits, the religious scholars, read their books, but they do not understand the real meaning."
P0056L18,"They give instructions to others, and then walk away, but they deal in Maya themselves."
P0056L19,"Speaking falsehood, they wander around the world, while those who remain true to the Shabad are excellent and exalted. ||6||"
P0056L20,There are so many Pandits and astrologers who ponder over the Vedas.
P0056L21,"They glorify their disputes and arguments, and in these controversies they continue coming and going."
P0056L22,"Without the Guru, they are not released from their karma, although they speak and listen and preach and explain. ||7||"
P0056L23,"They all call themselves virtuous, but I have no virtue at all."
P0056L24,"With the Lord as her Husband, the soul-bride is happy; I, too, love that God."
P0056L25,"O Nanak, through the Shabad, union is obtained; there is no more separation. ||8||5||"
P0056L26,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0056L27,"You may chant and meditate, practice austerities and self-restraint, and dwell at sacred shrines of pilgrimage;"
P0056L28,"You may give donations to charity, and perform good deeds, but without the True One, what is the use of it all?"
P0056L29,"As you plant, so shall you harvest. Without virtue, this human life passes away in vain. ||1||"
P0056L30,"O young bride, be a slave to virtue, and you shall find peace."
P0056L31,"Renouncing wrongful actions, following the Guru's Teachings, you shall be absorbed into the Perfect One. ||1||Pause||"
P0056L32,"Without capital, the trader looks around in all four directions."
P0056L33,He does not understand his own origins; the merchandise remains within the door of his own house.
P0056L34,"Without this commodity, there is great pain. The false are ruined by falsehood. ||2||"
P0056L35,One who contemplates and appraises this Jewel day and night reaps new profits.
P0056L36,"He finds the merchandise within his own home, and departs after arranging his affairs."
P0056L37,"So trade with the true traders, and as Gurmukh, contemplate God. ||3||"
P0056L38,"In the Society of the Saints, He is found, if the Uniter unites us."
P0056L39,"One whose heart is filled with His Infinite Light meets with Him, and shall never again be separated from Him."
P0056L40,"True is his position; he abides in Truth, with love and affection for the True One. ||4||"
P0056L41,One who understands himself finds the Mansion of the Lord's Presence within his own home.
P0056L42,"Imbued with the True Lord, Truth is gathered in."
P0057L01,God is known throughout the three worlds. True is the Name of the True One. ||5||
P0057L02,The wife who knows that her Husband Lord is always with her is very beautiful.
P0057L03,"The soul-bride is called to the Mansion of the His Presence, and her Husband Lord ravishes her with love."
P0057L04,The happy soul-bride is true and good; she is fascinated by the Glories of her Husband Lord. ||6||
P0057L05,"Wandering around and making mistakes, I climb the plateau; having climbed the plateau, I go up the mountain."
P0057L06,"But now I have lost my way, and I am wandering around in the forest; without the Guru, I do not understand."
P0057L07,"If I wander around forgetting God's Name, I shall continue coming and going in reincarnation, over and over again. ||7||"
P0057L08,"Go and ask the travellers, how to walk on the Path as His slave."
P0057L09,"They know the Lord to be their King, and at the Door to His Home, their way is not blocked."
P0057L10,"O Nanak, the One is pervading everywhere; there is no other at all. ||8||6||"
P0057L11,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0057L12,"Through the Guru, the Pure One is known, and the human body becomes pure as well."
P0057L13,"The Pure, True Lord abides within the mind; He knows the pain of our hearts."
P0057L14,"With intuitive ease, a great peace is found, and the arrow of death shall not strike you. ||1||"
P0057L15,"O Siblings of Destiny, filth is washed away by bathing in the Pure Water of the Name."
P0057L16,"You alone are Perfectly Pure, O True Lord; all other places are filled with filth. ||1||Pause||"
P0057L17,The Temple of the Lord is beautiful; it was made by the Creator Lord.
P0057L18,"The sun and the moon are lamps of incomparably beautiful light. Throughout the three worlds, the Infinite Light is pervading."
P0057L19,"In the shops of the city of the body, in the fortresses and in the huts, the True Merchandise is traded. ||2||"
P0057L20,"The ointment of spiritual wisdom is the destroyer of fear; through love, the Pure One is seen."
P0057L21,"The mysteries of the seen and the unseen are all known, if the mind is kept centered and balanced."
P0057L22,"If one finds such a True Guru, the Lord is met with intuitive ease. ||3||"
P0057L23,"He draws us to His Touchstone, to test our love and consciousness."
P0057L24,"The counterfeit have no place there, but the genuine are placed in His Treasury."
P0057L25,Let your hopes and anxieties depart; thus pollution is washed away. ||4||
P0057L26,Everyone begs for happiness; no one asks for suffering.
P0057L27,"But in the wake of happiness, there comes great suffering. The self-willed manmukhs do not understand this."
P0057L28,Those who see pain and pleasure as one and the same find peace; they are pierced through by the Shabad. ||5||
P0057L29,"The Vedas proclaim, and the words of Vyaasa tell us,"
P0057L30,"That the silent sages, the servants of the Lord, and those who practice a life of spiritual discipline are attuned to the Naam, the Treasure of Excellence."
P0057L31,Those who are attuned to the True Name win the game of life; I am forever a sacrifice to them. ||6||
P0057L32,Those who do not have the Naam in their mouths are filled with pollution; they are filthy throughout the four ages.
P0057L33,"Without loving devotion to God, their faces are blackened, and their honor is lost."
P0057L34,Those who have forgotten the Naam are plundered by evil; they weep and wail in dismay. ||7||
P0057L35,"I searched and searched, and found God. In the Fear of God, I have been united in His Union."
P0057L36,"Through self-realization, people dwell within the home of their inner being; egotism and desire depart."
P0057L37,"O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Name of the Lord are immaculate and radiant. ||8||7||"
P0057L38,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0057L39,"Listen, O deluded and demented mind: hold tight to the Guru's Feet."
P0057L40,"Chant and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; death will be afraid of you, and suffering shall depart."
P0057L41,The deserted wife suffers terrible pain. How can her Husband Lord remain with her forever? ||1||
P0058L01,"O Siblings of Destiny, I have no other place to go."
P0058L02,The Guru has given me the Treasure of the Wealth of the Naam; I am a sacrifice to Him. ||1||Pause||
P0058L03,The Guru's Teachings bring honor. Blessed is He-may I meet and be with Him!
P0058L04,"Without Him, I cannot live, even for a moment. Without His Name, I die."
P0058L05,"I am blind-may I never forget the Naam! Under His Protection, I shall reach my true home. ||2||"
P0058L06,"Those chaylaas, those devotees, whose spiritual teacher is blind, shall not find their place of rest."
P0058L07,"Without the True Guru, the Name is not obtained. Without the Name, what is the use of it all?"
P0058L08,"People come and go, regretting and repenting, like crows in a deserted house. ||3||"
P0058L09,"Without the Name, the body suffers in pain; it crumbles like a wall of sand."
P0058L10,"As long as Truth does not enter into the consciousness, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is not found."
P0058L11,"Attuned to the Shabad, we enter our home, and obtain the Eternal State of Nirvaanaa. ||4||"
P0058L12,"I ask my Guru for His Advice, and I follow the Guru's Advice."
P0058L13,"With the Shabads of Praise abiding in the mind, the pain of egotism is burnt away."
P0058L14,"We are intuitively united with Him, and we meet the Truest of the True. ||5||"
P0058L15,"Those who are attuned to the Shabad are spotless and pure; they renounce sexual desire, anger, selfishness and conceit."
P0058L16,"They sing the Praises of the Naam, forever and ever; they keep the Lord enshrined within their hearts."
P0058L17,How could we ever forget Him from our minds? He is the Support of all beings. ||6||
P0058L18,"One who dies in the Shabad is beyond death, and shall never die again."
P0058L19,"Through the Shabad, we find Him, and embrace love for the Name of the Lord."
P0058L20,"Without the Shabad, the world is deceived; it dies and is reborn, over and over again. ||7||"
P0058L21,"All praise themselves, and call themselves the greatest of the great."
P0058L22,"Without the Guru, one's self cannot be known. By merely speaking and listening, what is accomplished?"
P0058L23,"O Nanak, one who realizes the Shabad does not act in egotism. ||8||8||"
P0058L24,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0058L25,"Without her Husband, the soul-bride's youth and ornaments are useless and wretched."
P0058L26,"She does not enjoy the pleasure of His Bed; without her Husband, her ornaments are absurd."
P0058L27,The discarded bride suffers terrible pain; her Husband does not come to the bed of her home. ||1||
P0058L28,"O mind, meditate on the Lord, and find peace."
P0058L29,"Without the Guru, love is not found. United with the Shabad, happiness is found. ||1||Pause||"
P0058L30,"Serving the Guru, she finds peace, and her Husband Lord adorns her with intuitive wisdom."
P0058L31,"Truly, she enjoys the Bed of her Husband, through her deep love and affection."
P0058L32,"As Gurmukh, she comes to know Him. Meeting with the Guru, she maintains a virtuous lifestyle. ||2||"
P0058L33,"Through Truth, meet your Husband Lord, O soul-bride. Enchanted by your Husband, enshrine love for Him."
P0058L34,Your mind and body shall blossom forth in Truth. The value of this cannot be described.
P0058L35,The soul-bride finds her Husband Lord in the home of her own being; she is purified by the True Name. ||3||
P0058L36,"If the mind within the mind dies, then the Husband ravishes and enjoys His bride."
P0058L37,"They are woven into one texture, like pearls on a necklace around the neck."
P0058L38,"In the Society of the Saints, peace wells up; the Gurmukhs take the Support of the Naam. ||4||"
P0058L39,"In an instant, one is born, and in an instant, one dies. In an instant one comes, and in an instant one goes."
P0058L40,"One who recognizes the Shabad merges into it, and is not afflicted by death."
P0059L01,Our Lord and Master is Unweighable; He cannot be weighed. He cannot be found merely by talking. ||5||
P0059L02,The merchants and the traders have come; their profits are pre-ordained.
P0059L03,"Those who practice Truth reap the profits, abiding in the Will of God."
P0059L04,"With the Merchandise of Truth, they meet the Guru, who does not have a trace of greed. ||6||"
P0059L05,"As Gurmukh, they are weighed and measured, in the balance and the scales of Truth."
P0059L06,"The enticements of hope and desire are quieted by the Guru, whose Word is True."
P0059L07,He Himself weighs with the scale; perfect is the weighing of the Perfect One. ||7||
P0059L08,"No one is saved by mere talk and speech, nor by reading loads of books."
P0059L09,The body does not obtain purity without loving devotion to the Lord.
P0059L10,"O Nanak, never forget the Naam; the Guru shall unite us with the Creator. ||8||9||"
P0059L11,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0059L12,"Meeting the Perfect True Guru, we find the jewel of meditative reflection."
P0059L13,"Surrendering our minds to our Guru, we find universal love."
P0059L14,"We find the wealth of liberation, and our demerits are erased. ||1||"
P0059L15,"O Siblings of Destiny, without the Guru, there is no spiritual wisdom."
P0059L16,"Go and ask Brahma, Naarad and Vyaas, the writer of the Vedas. ||1||Pause||"
P0059L17,"Know that from the vibration of the Word, we obtain spiritual wisdom and meditation. Through it, we speak the Unspoken."
P0059L18,"He is the fruit-bearing Tree, luxuriantly green with abundant shade."
P0059L19,"The rubies, jewels and emeralds are in the Guru's Treasury. ||2||"
P0059L20,"From the Guru's Treasury, we receive the Love of the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord."
P0059L21,"We gather in the True Merchandise, through the Perfect Grace of the Infinite."
P0059L22,"The True Guru is the Giver of peace, the Dispeller of pain, the Destroyer of demons. ||3||"
P0059L23,The terrifying world-ocean is difficult and dreadful; there is no shore on this side or the one beyond.
P0059L24,"There is no boat, no raft, no oars and no boatman."
P0059L25,The True Guru is the only boat on this terrifying ocean. His Glance of Grace carries us across. ||4||
P0059L26,"If I forget my Beloved, even for an instant, suffering overtakes me and peace departs."
P0059L27,"Let that tongue be burnt in flames, which does not chant the Naam with love."
P0059L28,"When the pitcher of the body bursts, there is terrible pain; those who are caught by the Minister of Death regret and repent. ||5||"
P0059L29,"Crying out, """"Mine! Mine!"""", they have departed, but their bodies, their wealth, and their wives did not go with them."
P0059L30,"Without the Name, wealth is useless; deceived by wealth, they have lost their way."
P0059L31,"So serve the True Lord; become Gurmukh, and speak the Unspoken. ||6||"
P0059L32,"Coming and going, people wander through reincarnation; they act according to their past actions."
P0059L33,How can one's pre-ordained destiny be erased? It is written in accordance with the Lord's Will.
P0059L34,"Without the Name of the Lord, no one can be saved. Through the Guru's Teachings, we are united in His Union. ||7||"
P0059L35,"Without Him, I have no one to call my own. My soul and my breath of life belong to Him."
P0059L36,"May my egotism and possessiveness be burnt to ashes, and my greed and egotistical pride consigned to the fire."
P0059L37,"O Nanak, contemplating the Shabad, the Treasure of Excellence is obtained. ||8||10||"
P0059L38,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0059L39,"O mind, love the Lord, as the lotus loves the water."
P0059L40,"Tossed about by the waves, it still blossoms with love."
P0059L41,"In the water, the creatures are created; outside of the water they die. ||1||"
P0060L01,"O mind, how can you be saved without love?"
P0060L02,God permeates the inner beings of the Gurmukhs. They are blessed with the treasure of devotion. ||1||Pause||
P0060L03,"O mind, love the Lord, as the fish loves the water."
P0060L04,"The more the water, the more the happiness, and the greater the peace of mind and body."
P0060L05,"Without water, she cannot live, even for an instant. God knows the suffering of her mind. ||2||"
P0060L06,"O mind, love the Lord, as the song-bird loves the rain."
P0060L07,"The pools are overflowing with water, and the land is luxuriantly green, but what are they to her, if that single drop of rain does not fall into her mouth?"
P0060L08,"By His Grace, she receives it; otherwise, because of her past actions, she gives her head. ||3||"
P0060L09,"O mind, love the Lord, as the water loves the milk."
P0060L10,"The water, added to the milk, itself bears the heat, and prevents the milk from burning."
P0060L11,"God unites the separated ones with Himself again, and blesses them with true greatness. ||4||"
P0060L12,"O mind, love the Lord, as the chakvee duck loves the sun."
P0060L13,"She does not sleep, for an instant or a moment; the sun is so far away, but she thinks that it is near."
P0060L14,"Understanding does not come to the self-willed manmukh. But to the Gurmukh, the Lord is always close. ||5||"
P0060L15,"The self-willed manmukhs make their calculations and plans, but only the actions of the Creator come to pass."
P0060L16,"His Value cannot be estimated, even though everyone may wish to do so."
P0060L17,"Through the Guru's Teachings, it is revealed. Meeting with the True One, peace is found. ||6||"
P0060L18,"True love shall not be broken, if the True Guru is met."
P0060L19,"Obtaining the wealth of spiritual wisdom, the understanding of the three worlds is acquired."
P0060L20,"So become a customer of merit, and do not forget the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||7||"
P0060L21,Those birds which peck at the shore of the pool have played and have departed.
P0060L22,"In a moment, in an instant, we too must depart. Our play is only for today or tomorrow."
P0060L23,"But those whom You unite, Lord, are united with You; they obtain a seat in the Arena of Truth. ||8||"
P0060L24,"Without the Guru, love does not well up, and the filth of egotism does not depart."
P0060L25,"One who recognizes within himself that, """"He is me"""", and who is pierced through by the Shabad, is satisfied."
P0060L26,"When one becomes Gurmukh and realizes his own self, what more is there left to do or have done? ||9||"
P0060L27,"Why speak of union to those who are already united with the Lord? Receiving the Shabad, they are satisfied."
P0060L28,"The self-willed manmukhs do not understand; separated from Him, they endure beatings."
P0060L29,"O Nanak, there is only the one door to His Home; there is no other place at all. ||10||11||"
P0060L30,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0060L31,"The self-willed manmukhs wander around, deluded and deceived. They find no place of rest."
P0060L32,"Without the Guru, no one is shown the Way. Like the blind, they continue coming and going."
P0060L33,"Having lost the treasure of spiritual wisdom, they depart, defrauded and plundered. ||1||"
P0060L34,"O Baba, Maya deceives with its illusion."
P0060L35,"Deceived by doubt, the discarded bride is not received into the Lap of her Beloved. ||1||Pause||"
P0060L36,"The deceived bride wanders around in foreign lands; she leaves, and abandons her own home."
P0060L37,"Deceived, she climbs the plateaus and mountains; her mind wavers in doubt."
P0060L38,"Separated from the Primal Being, how can she meet with Him again? Plundered by pride, she cries out and bewails. ||2||"
P0060L39,"The Guru unites the separated ones with the Lord again, through the love of the Delicious Name of the Lord."
P0061L01,"Through truth and intuitive poise, great honor is obtained, with the Support of the Naam and the Glory of the Lord."
P0061L02,"As it pleases You, Lord, please save and protect me. Without You, O my Husband Lord, who else is there for me? ||3||"
P0061L03,"Reading their books over and over again, people continue making mistakes; they are so proud of their religious robes."
P0061L04,"But what is the use of bathing at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, when the filth of stubborn pride is within the mind?"
P0061L05,"Other than the Guru, who can explain that within the mind is the Lord, the King, the Emperor? ||4||"
P0061L06,"The Treasure of the Lord's Love is obtained by the Gurmukh, who contemplates the essence of reality."
P0061L07,"The bride eradicates her selfishness, and adorns herself with the Word of the Guru's Shabad."
P0061L08,"Within her own home, she finds her Husband, through infinite love for the Guru. ||5||"
P0061L09,"Applying oneself to the service of the Guru, the mind is purified, and peace is obtained."
P0061L10,"The Word of the Guru's Shabad abides within the mind, and egotism is eliminated from within."
P0061L11,"The Treasure of the Naam is acquired, and the mind reaps the lasting profit. ||6||"
P0061L12,"If He grants His Grace, then we obtain it. We cannot find it by our own efforts."
P0061L13,"Remain attached to the Feet of the Guru, and eradicate selfishness from within."
P0061L14,"Attuned to Truth, you shall obtain the True One. ||7||"
P0061L15,Everyone makes mistakes; only the Guru and the Creator are infallible.
P0061L16,One who instructs his mind with the Guru's Teachings comes to embrace love for the Lord.
P0061L17,"O Nanak, do not forget the Truth; you shall receive the Infinite Word of the Shabad. ||8||12||"
P0061L18,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0061L19,"The enticing desire for Maya leads people to become emotionally attached to their children, relatives, households and spouses."
P0061L20,"The world is deceived and plundered by riches, youth, greed and egotism."
P0061L21,"The drug of emotional attachment has destroyed me, as it has destroyed the whole world. ||1||"
P0061L22,"O my Beloved, I have no one except You."
P0061L23,"Without You, nothing else pleases me. Loving You, I am at peace. ||1||Pause||"
P0061L24,"I sing the Praises of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, with love; I am content with the Word of the Guru's Shabad."
P0061L25,Whatever is seen shall pass away. So do not be attached to this false show.
P0061L26,"Like a traveller in his travels, you have come. Behold the caravan leaving each day. ||2||"
P0061L27,"Many preach sermons, but without the Guru, understanding is not obtained."
P0061L28,"If someone receives the Glory of the Naam, he is attuned to truth and blessed with honor."
P0061L29,Those who are pleasing to You are good; no one is counterfeit or genuine. ||3||
P0061L30,In the Guru's Sanctuary we are saved. The assets of the self-willed manmukhs are false.
P0061L31,The eight metals of the King are made into coins by the Word of His Shabad.
P0061L32,"The Assayer Himself assays them, and He places the genuine ones in His Treasury. ||4||"
P0061L33,Your Value cannot be appraised; I have seen and tested everything.
P0061L34,"By speaking, His Depth cannot be found. Abiding in truth, honor is obtained."
P0061L35,"Through the Guru's Teachings, I praise You; otherwise, I cannot describe Your Value. ||5||"
P0061L36,That body which does not appreciate the Naam-that body is infested with egotism and conflict.
P0061L37,"Without the Guru, spiritual wisdom is not obtained; other tastes are poison."
P0061L38,"Without virtue, nothing is of any use. The taste of Maya is bland and insipid. ||6||"
P0061L39,"Through desire, people are cast into the womb and reborn. Through desire, they taste the sweet and sour flavors."
P0061L40,"Bound by desire, they are led on, beaten and struck on their faces and mouths."
P0061L41,"Bound and gagged and assaulted by evil, they are released only through the Name, through the Guru's Teachings. ||7||"
P0062L01,"In all places, You are the One and Only. As it pleases You, Lord, please save and protect me!"
P0062L02,"Through the Guru's Teachings, the True One abides within the mind. The Companionship of the Naam brings the most excellent honor."
P0062L03,"Eradicate the disease of egotism, and chant the True Shabad, the Word of the True Lord. ||8||"
P0062L04,"You are pervading throughout the Akaashic Ethers, the nether regions and the three worlds."
P0062L05,"You Yourself are bhakti, loving devotional worship. You Yourself unite us in Union with Yourself."
P0062L06,"O Nanak, may I never forget the Naam! As is Your Pleasure, so is Your Will. ||9||13||"
P0062L07,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0062L08,My mind is pierced through by the Name of the Lord. What else should I contemplate?
P0062L09,"Focusing your awareness on the Shabad, happiness wells up. Attuned to God, the most excellent peace is found."
P0062L10,"As it pleases You, please save me, Lord. The Name of the Lord is my Support. ||1||"
P0062L11,"O mind, the Will of our Lord and Master is true."
P0062L12,Focus your love upon the One who created and adorned your body and mind. ||1||Pause||
P0062L13,"If I cut my body into pieces, and burn them in the fire,"
P0062L14,"And if I make my body and mind into firewood, and night and day burn them in the fire,"
P0062L15,"And if I perform hundreds of thousands and millions of religious rituals-still, all these are not equal to the Name of the Lord. ||2||"
P0062L16,"If my body were cut in half, if a saw was put to my head,"
P0062L17,"And if my body were frozen in the Himalayas-even then, my mind would not be free of disease."
P0062L18,None of these are equal to the Name of the Lord. I have seen and tried and tested them all. ||3||
P0062L19,"If I made a donation of castles of gold, and gave lots of fine horses and wondrous elephants in charity,"
P0062L20,"And if I made donations of land and cows-even then, pride and ego would still be within me."
P0062L21,The Name of the Lord has pierced my mind; the Guru has given me this true gift. ||4||
P0062L22,"There are so many stubborn-minded intelligent people, and so many who contemplate the Vedas."
P0062L23,There are so many entanglements for the soul. Only as Gurmukh do we find the Gate of Liberation.
P0062L24,Truth is higher than everything; but higher still is truthful living. ||5||
P0062L25,Call everyone exalted; no one seems lowly.
P0062L26,"The One Lord has fashioned the vessels, and His One Light pervades the three worlds."
P0062L27,"Receiving His Grace, we obtain Truth. No one can erase His Primal Blessing. ||6||"
P0062L28,"When one Holy person meets another Holy person, they abide in contentment, through the Love of the Guru."
P0062L29,"They contemplate the Unspoken Speech, merging in absorption in the True Guru."
P0062L30,"Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, they are contented; they go to the Court of the Lord in robes of honor. ||7||"
P0062L31,"In each and every heart the Music of the Lord's Flute vibrates, night and day, with sublime love for the Shabad."
P0062L32,Only those few who become Gurmukh understand this by instructing their minds.
P0062L33,"O Nanak, do not forget the Naam. Practicing the Shabad you shall be saved. ||8||14||"
P0062L34,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0062L35,"There are painted mansions to behold, white-washed, with beautiful doors;"
P0062L36,"They were constructed to give pleasure to the mind, but this is only for the sake of the love of duality."
P0062L37,The inner being is empty without love. The body shall crumble into a heap of ashes. ||1||
P0062L38,"O Siblings of Destiny, this body and wealth shall not go along with you."
P0062L39,"The Lord's Name is the pure wealth; through the Guru, God bestows this gift. ||1||Pause||"
P0062L40,The Lord's Name is the pure wealth; it is given only by the Giver.
P0062L41,"One who has the Guru, the Creator, as his Friend, shall not be questioned hereafter."
P0062L42,He Himself delivers those who are delivered. He Himself is the Forgiver. ||2||
P0063L01,"The self-willed manmukh looks upon his daughters, sons and relatives as his own."
P0063L02,"Gazing upon his wife, he is pleased. But along with happiness, they bring grief."
P0063L03,"The Gurmukhs are attuned to the Word of the Shabad. Day and night, they enjoy the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||3||"
P0063L04,"The consciousness of the wicked, faithless cynics wanders around in search of transitory wealth, unstable and distracted."
P0063L05,"Searching outside of themselves, they are ruined; the object of their search is in that sacred place within the home of the heart."
P0063L06,"The self-willed manmukhs, in their ego, miss it; the Gurmukhs receive it in their laps. ||4||"
P0063L07,"You worthless, faithless cynic-recognize your own origin!"
P0063L08,This body is made of blood and semen. It shall be consigned to the fire in the end.
P0063L09,"The body is under the power of the breath, according to the True Sign inscribed upon your forehead. ||5||"
P0063L10,Everyone begs for a long life-no one wishes to die.
P0063L11,"A life of peace and comfort comes to that Gurmukh, within whom God dwells."
P0063L12,"Without the Naam, what good those who do not have the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of the Lord and Guru? ||6||"
P0063L13,"In their dreams at night, people wander around as long as they sleep;"
P0063L14,"Just so, they are under the power of the snake Maya, as long as their hearts are filled with ego and duality."
P0063L15,"Through the Guru's Teachings, they come to understand and see that this world is just a dream. ||7||"
P0063L16,"As thirst is quenched with water, and the baby is satisfied with mother's milk,"
P0063L17,"And as the lotus does not exist without water, and as the fish dies without water"
P0063L18,"-O Nanak, so does the Gurmukh live, receiving the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||8||15||"
P0063L19,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0063L20,"Beholding the terrifying mountain in this world of my father's home, I am terrified."
P0063L21,It is so difficult to climb this high mountain; there is no ladder which reaches up there.
P0063L22,"But as Gurmukh, I know that it is within my self; the Guru has brought me to Union, and so I cross over. ||1||"
P0063L23,"O Siblings of Destiny, the terrifying world-ocean is so difficult to cross-I am terrified!"
P0063L24,"The Perfect True Guru, in His Pleasure, has met with me; the Guru has saved me, through the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||"
P0063L25,"I may say, """"I am going, I am going"""", but I know that, in the end, I must really go."
P0063L26,Whoever comes must also go. Only the Guru and the Creator are Eternal.
P0063L27,"So praise the True One continually, and love His Place of Truth. ||2||"
P0063L28,"Beautiful gates, houses and palaces, solidly built forts,"
P0063L29,"Elephants, saddled horses, hundreds of thousands of uncounted armies"
P0063L30,"-none of these will go along with anyone in the end, and yet, the fools bother themselves to exhaustion with these, and then die. ||3||"
P0063L31,"You may gather gold and sliver, but wealth is just a net of entanglement."
P0063L32,"You may beat the drum and proclaim authority over the whole world, but without the Name, death hovers over your head."
P0063L33,"When the body falls, the play of life is over; what shall be the condition of the evil-doers then? ||4||"
P0063L34,"The husband is delighted seeing his sons, and his wife upon his bed."
P0063L35,"He applies sandalwood and scented oils, and dresses himself in his beautiful clothes."
P0063L36,"But dust shall mix with dust, and he shall depart, leaving hearth and home behind. ||5||"
P0063L37,"He may be called a chief, an emperor, a king, a governor or a lord;"
P0063L38,"He may present himself as a leader or a chief, but this just burns him in the fire of egotistical pride."
P0063L39,"The self-willed manmukh has forgotten the Naam. He is like straw, burning in the forest fire. ||6||"
P0063L40,"Whoever comes into the world and indulges in ego, must depart."
P0064L01,The whole world is a store-house of lamp-black; the body and mind are blackened with it.
P0064L02,"Those who are saved by the Guru are immaculate and pure; through the Word of the Shabad, they extinguish the fire of desire. ||7||"
P0064L03,"O Nanak, they swim across with the True Name of the Lord, the King above the heads of kings."
P0064L04,May I never forget the Name of the Lord! I have purchased the Jewel of the Lord's Name.
P0064L05,"The self-willed manmukhs putrefy and die in the terrifying world-ocean, while the Gurmukhs cross over the bottomless ocean. ||8||16||"
P0064L06,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0064L07,"They have made this their resting place and they sit at home, but the urge to depart is always there."
P0064L08,"This would be known as a lasting place of rest, only if they were to remain stable and unchanging. ||1||"
P0064L09,What sort of a resting place is this world?
P0064L10,"Doing deeds of faith, pack up the supplies for your journey, and remain committed to the Name. ||1||Pause||"
P0064L11,"The Yogis sit in their Yogic postures, and the Mullahs sit at their resting stations."
P0064L12,"The Hindu Pandits recite from their books, and the Siddhas sit in the temples of their gods. ||2||"
P0064L13,"The angels, Siddhas, worshippers of Shiva, heavenly musicians, silent sages, Saints, priests, preachers, spiritual teachers and commanders"
P0064L14,"-each and every one has left, and all others shall depart as well. ||3||"
P0064L15,"The sultans and kings, the rich and the mighty, have marched away in succession."
P0064L16,"In a moment or two, we shall also depart. O my heart, understand that you must go as well! ||4||"
P0064L17,This is described in the Shabads; only a few understand this!
P0064L18,"Nanak offers this prayer to the One who pervades the water, the land and the air. ||5||"
P0064L19,"He is Allah, the Unknowable, the Inaccessible, All-powerful and Merciful Creator."
P0064L20,All the world comes and goes-only the Merciful Lord is permanent. ||6||
P0064L21,"Call permanent only the One, who does not have destiny inscribed upon His Forehead."
P0064L22,The sky and the earth shall pass away; He alone is permanent. ||7||
P0064L23,The day and the sun shall pass away; the night and the moon shall pass away; the hundreds of thousands of stars shall disappear.
P0064L24,He alone is permanent; Nanak speaks the Truth. ||8||17||

P0064L26,"Siree Raag, Third Mehl, First House, Ashtapadees:"
P0064L27,One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
P0064L28,"By God's Grace, the Gurmukh practices devotion; without the Guru, there is no devotional worship."
P0064L29,"One who merges his own self into Him understands, and so becomes pure."
P0064L30,"The Dear Lord is True, and True is the Word of His Bani. Through the Word of the Shabad, Union with Him is obtained. ||1||"
P0064L31,"O Siblings of Destiny, without devotion, why have people even come into the world?"
P0064L32,They have not served the Perfect Guru; they have wasted their lives in vain. ||1||Pause||
P0064L33,"The Lord Himself, the Life of the World, is the Giver. He Himself forgives, and unites us with Himself."
P0064L34,What are these poor beings and creatures? What can they speak and say?
P0064L35,God Himself grants glory to the Gurmukhs; He joins them to His Service. ||2||
P0064L36,"Beholding your family, you are lured away by emotional attachment, but when you leave, they will not go with you."
P0065L01,"Serving the True Guru, I have found the Treasure of Excellence. Its value cannot be estimated."

P0065L03,"In this world of my father's home, the Great Giver is the Life of the World. The self-willed manmukhs have lost their honor."
P0065L04,"Without the True Guru, no one knows the Way. The blind find no place of rest."
P0065L05,"If the Lord, the Giver of Peace, does not dwell within the mind, then they shall depart with regret in the end. ||4||"
P0065L06,"In this world of my father's house, through the Guru's Teachings, I have cultivated within my mind the Great Giver, the Life of the World."
P0065L07,"Night and day, performing devotional worship, day and night, ego and emotional attachment are removed."
P0065L08,"And then, attuned to Him, we become like Him, truly absorbed in the True One. ||5||"
P0065L09,"Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He gives us His Love, and we contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad."
P0065L10,"Serving the True Guru, intuitive peace wells up, and ego and desire die."
P0065L11,"The Lord, the Giver of Virtue, dwells forever within the minds of those who keep Truth enshrined within their hearts. ||6||"
P0065L12,"My God is forever Immaculate and Pure; with a pure mind, He can be found."
P0065L13,"If the Treasure of the Name of the Lord abides within the mind, egotism and pain are totally eliminated."
P0065L14,The True Guru has instructed me in the Word of the Shabad. I am forever a sacrifice to Him. ||7||
P0065L15,"Within your own conscious mind, you may say anything, but without the Guru, selfishness and conceit are not eradicated."
P0065L16,"The Dear Lord is the Lover of His devotees, the Giver of Peace. By His Grace, He abides within the mind."
P0065L17,"O Nanak, God blesses us with the sublime awakening of consciousness; He Himself grants glorious greatness to the Gurmukh. ||8||1||18||"
P0065L18,"Siree Raag, Third Mehl,"
P0065L19,Those who go around acting in egotism are struck down by the Messenger of Death with his club.
P0065L20,"Those who serve the True Guru are uplifted and saved, in love with the Lord. ||1||"
P0065L21,"O mind, become Gurmukh, and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord."
P0065L22,"Those who are so pre-destined by the Creator are absorbed into the Naam, through the Guru's Teachings. ||1||Pause||"
P0065L23,"Without the True Guru, faith does not come, and love for the Naam is not embraced."
P0065L24,"Even in dreams, they find no peace; they sleep immersed in pain. ||2||"
P0065L25,"Even if you chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with great longing, your past actions are still not erased."
P0065L26,The Lord's devotees surrender to His Will; those devotees are accepted at His Door. ||3||
P0065L27,"The Guru has lovingly implanted the Word of His Shabad within me. Without His Grace, it cannot be attained."

P0065L31,"Acting in stubborn-mindedness, no one is saved; go and study the Simritees and the Shaastras."
P0065L32,"Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and practicing the Shabads of the Guru, you shall be saved. ||6||"
P0065L33,"The Name of the Lord is the Treasure, which has no end or limitation."

P0066L05,"O mind, work to serve the Guru."

P0066L07,The birds in the beautiful trees fly around in all four directions.
P0066L08,"The more they fly around, the more they suffer; they burn and cry out in pain."

P0072L38,All strict rituals are just clever contrivances.
P0072L39,My God knows everything.
P0072L40,"He has made His Glory manifest, and all people celebrate Him. ||17 |"
P0072L41,| He has not considered my merits and demerits;
P0072L42,This is God's Own Nature.
P0072L43,"Hugging me close in His Embrace, He protects me, and now, even the hot wind does not touch me. ||18||"
P0072L44,"Within my mind and body, I meditate on God."
P0072L45,I have obtained the fruits of my soul's desire.
P0072L46,"You are the Supreme Lord and Master, above the heads of kings. Nanak lives by chanting Your Name. ||19||"
P0073L01,You Yourself created the Universe;
P0073L02,"You created the play of duality, and staged it."

P0073L04,"By Guru's Grace, I have found God."
P0073L05,"By His Grace, I have shed emotional attachment to Maya."

P0073L07,"You are the Gopis, the milk-maids of Krishna; You are the sacred river Jamunaa; You are Krishna, the herdsman."
P0073L08,You Yourself support the world.
P0073L09,"By Your Command, human beings are fashioned. You Yourself embellish them, and then again destroy them. ||22||"
P0073L10,Those who have focused their consciousness on the True Guru
P0073L11,Have rid themselves of the love of duality.
P0073L12,The light of those mortal beings is immaculate. They depart after redeeming their lives. ||23||
P0073L13,"Forever and ever, night and day,"
P0073L14,I praise the Greatness of Your Goodness.
P0073L15,"You bestow Your Gifts, even if we do not ask for them. Says Nanak, contemplate the True Lord. ||24||1||"
P0073L16,"Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:"
P0073L17,I fall at His Feet to please and appease Him.
P0073L18,"The True Guru has united me with the Lord, the Primal Being. There is no other as great as He. ||1||Pause||"
P0073L19,The Lord of the Universe is my Sweet Beloved.
P0073L20,He is sweeter than my mother or father.
P0073L21,"Among all sisters and brothers and friends, there is no one like You. ||1||"
P0073L22,"By Your Command, the month of Saawan has come."
P0073L23,"I have hooked up the plow of Truth,"
P0073L24,"And I plant the seed of the Name in hopes that the Lord, in His Generosity, will bestow a bountiful harvest. ||2||"
P0073L25,"Meeting with the Guru, I recognize only the One Lord."
P0073L26,"In my consciousness, I do not know of any other account."
P0073L27,"The Lord has assigned one task to me; as it pleases Him, I perform it. ||3||"
P0073L28,"Enjoy yourselves and eat, O Siblings of Destiny."
P0073L29,"In the Guru's Court, He has blessed me with the Robe of Honor."
P0073L30,I have become the Master of my body-village; I have taken the five rivals as prisoners. ||4||
P0073L31,I have come to Your Sanctuary.
P0073L32,The five farm-hands have become my tenants;
P0073L33,"None dare to raise their heads against me. O Nanak, my village is populous and prosperous. ||5||"
P0073L34,"I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You."
P0073L35,I meditate on You continually.
P0073L36,"The village was in ruins, but You have re-populated it. I am a sacrifice to You. ||6||"

P0073L46,I have established the Temple of Truth.
P0073L47,"I sought out the Guru's Sikhs, and brought them into it."
P0073L48,"I wash their feet, and wave the fan over them. Bowing low, I fall at their feet. ||10||"
P0074L01,"I heard of the Guru, and so I went to Him."
P0074L02,"He instilled within me the Naam, the goodness of charity and true cleansing."
P0074L03,"All the world is liberated, O Nanak, by embarking upon the Boat of Truth. ||11||"
P0074L04,"The whole Universe serves You, day and night."
P0074L05,"Please hear my prayer, O Dear Lord."
P0074L06,"I have thoroughly tested and seen all-You alone, by Your Pleasure, can save us. ||12||"

P0074L10,"Softly and gently, drop by drop, the Ambrosial Nectar trickles down."
P0074L11,I speak as my Lord and Master causes me to speak.
P0074L12,I place all my faith in You; please accept me. ||14||
P0074L13,Your devotees are forever hungry for You.
P0074L14,"O Lord, please fulfill my desires."
P0074L15,"Grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Giver of Peace. Please, take me into Your Embrace. ||15||"
P0074L16,I have not found any other as Great as You.
P0074L17,"You pervade the continents, the worlds and the nether regions;"
P0074L18,You are permeating all places and interspaces. Nanak: You are the True Support of Your devotees. ||16||
P0074L19,I am a wrestler; I belong to the Lord of the World.
P0074L20,"I met with the Guru, and I have tied a tall, plumed turban."
P0074L21,"All have gathered to watch the wrestling match, and the Merciful Lord Himself is seated to behold it. ||17||"
P0074L22,The bugles play and the drums beat.
P0074L23,The wrestlers enter the arena and circle around.
P0074L24,"I have thrown the five challengers to the ground, and the Guru has patted me on the back. ||18||"
P0074L25,"All have gathered together,"
P0074L26,But we shall return home by different routes.
P0074L27,"The Gurmukhs reap their profits and leave, while the self-willed manmukhs lose their investment and depart. ||19||"
P0074L28,You are without color or mark.
P0074L29,The Lord is seen to be manifest and present.
P0074L30,"Hearing of Your Glories again and again, Your devotees meditate on You; they are attuned to You, O Lord, Treasure of Excellence. ||20||"
P0074L31,"Through age after age, I am the servant of the Merciful Lord."
P0074L32,The Guru has cut away my bonds.
P0074L33,"I shall not have to dance in the wrestling arena of life again. Nanak has searched, and found this opportunity. ||21||2||29||"
P0074L34,One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
P0074L35,"Siree Raag, First Mehl, Pehray, First House:"
P0074L36,"In the first watch of the night O my merchant friend you were cast into the womb, by the Lord's Command."
P0074L37,"Upside-down, within the womb, you performed penance, O my merchant friend, and you prayed to your Lord and Master."
P0074L38,"You uttered prayers to your Lord and Master, while upside-down, and you meditated on Him with deep love and affection."
P0074L39,"You came into this Dark Age of Kali Yuga naked, and you shall depart again naked."
P0074L40,"As God's Pen has written on your forehead, so it shall be with your soul."
P0074L41,"Says Nanak, in the first watch of the night, by the Hukam of the Lord's Command, you enter into the womb. ||1||"
P0075L01,"In the second watch of the night, O my merchant friend, you have forgotten to meditate."
P0075L02,"From hand to hand, you are passed around, O my merchant friend, like Krishna in the house of Yashoda."
P0075L03,"From hand to hand, you are passed around, and your mother says, """"This is my son."""""
P0075L04,"O, my thoughtless and foolish mind, think: In the end, nothing shall be yours."
P0075L05,You do not know the One who created the creation. Gather spiritual wisdom within your mind.
P0075L06,"Says Nanak, in the second watch of the night, you have forgotten to meditate. ||2||"
P0075L07,"In the third watch of the night, O my merchant friend, your consciousness is focused on wealth and youth."
P0075L08,"You have not remembered the Name of the Lord, O my merchant friend, although it would release you from bondage."
P0075L09,"You do not remember the Name of the Lord, and you become confused by Maya."
P0075L10,"Revelling in your riches and intoxicated with youth, you waste your life uselessly."
P0075L11,You have not traded in righteousness and Dharma; you have not made good deeds your friends.
P0075L12,"Says Nanak, in the third watch of the night, your mind is attached to wealth and youth. ||3||"
P0075L13,"In the fourth watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the Grim Reaper comes to the field."
P0075L14,"When the Messenger of Death seizes and dispatches you, O my merchant friend, no one knows the mystery of where you have gone."
P0075L15,"So think of the Lord! No one knows this secret, of when the Messenger of Death will seize you and take you away."
P0075L16,"All your weeping and wailing then is false. In an instant, you become a stranger."
P0075L17,You obtain exactly what you have longed for.
P0075L18,"Says Nanak, in the fourth watch of the night, O mortal, the Grim Reaper has harvested your field. ||4||1||"
P0075L19,"Siree Raag, First Mehl:"
P0075L20,"In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend, your innocent mind has a child-like understanding."
P0075L21,"You drink milk, and you are fondled so gently, O my merchant friend."
P0075L22,"The mother and father love their child so much, but in Maya, all are caught in emotional attachment."
P0075L23,"By the good fortune of good deeds done in the past, you have come, and now you perform actions to determine your future."
P0075L24,"Without the Lord's Name, liberation is not obtained, and you are drowned in the love of duality."
P0075L25,"Says Nanak, in the first watch of the night, O mortal, you shall be saved by remembering the Lord. ||1||"
P0075L26,"In the second watch of the night, O my merchant friend, you are intoxicated with the wine of youth and beauty."
P0075L27,"Day and night, you are engrossed in sexual desire, O my merchant friend, and your consciousness is blind to the Naam."
P0075L28,"The Lord's Name is not within your heart, but all sorts of other tastes seem sweet to you."
P0075L29,"You have no wisdom at all, no meditation, no virtue or self-discipline; in falsehood, you are caught in the cycle of birth and death."
P0075L30,"Pilgrimages, fasts, purification and self-discipline are of no use, nor are rituals, religious ceremonies or empty worship."
P0075L31,"O Nanak, emancipation comes only by loving devotional worship; through duality, people are engrossed in duality. ||2||"
P0075L32,"In the third watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the swans, the white hairs, come and land upon the pool of the head."
P0075L33,"Youth wears itself out, and old age triumphs, O my merchant friend; as time passes, your days diminish."
P0076L01,"At the last moment, you repent-you are so blind!-when the Messenger of Death seizes you and carries you away."
P0076L02,"You kept all your things for yourself, but in an instant, they are all lost."
P0076L03,"Your intellect left you, your wisdom departed, and now you repent for the evil deeds you committed."
P0076L04,"Says Nanak, O mortal, in the third watch of the night, let your consciousness be lovingly focused on God. ||3||"
P0076L05,"In the fourth watch of the night, O my merchant friend, your body grows old and weak."
P0076L06,"Your eyes go blind, and cannot see, O my merchant friend, and your ears do not hear any words."
P0076L07,"Your eyes go blind, and your tongue is unable to taste; you live only with the help of others."
P0076L08,"With no virtue within, how can you find peace? The self-willed manmukh comes and goes in reincarnation."
P0076L09,"When the crop of life has matured, it bends, breaks and perishes; why take pride in that which comes and goes?"
P0076L10,"Says Nanak, O mortal, in the fourth watch of the night, the Gurmukh recognizes the Word of the Shabad. ||4||"
P0076L11,"Your breath comes to its end, O my merchant friend, and your shoulders are weighed down by the tyrant of old age."
P0076L12,"Not one iota of virtue came into you, O my merchant friend; bound and gagged by evil, you are driven along."
P0076L13,"One who departs with virtue and self-discipline is not struck down, and is not consigned to the cycle of birth and death."
P0076L14,"The Messenger of Death and his trap cannot touch him; through loving devotional worship, he crosses over the ocean of fear."
P0076L15,"He departs with honor, and merges in intuitive peace and poise; all his pains depart."
P0076L16,"Says Nanak, when the mortal becomes Gurmukh, he is saved and honored by the True Lord. ||5||2||"
P0076L17,"Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl:"
P0076L18,"In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the Lord places you in the womb."
P0076L19,"You meditate on the Lord, and chant the Lord's Name, O my merchant friend. You contemplate the Name of the Lord, Har, Har."
P0076L20,"Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and meditating on it within the fire of the womb, your life is sustained by dwelling on the Naam."
P0076L21,"You are born and you come out, and your mother and father are delighted to see your face."
P0076L22,"Remember the One, O mortal, to whom the child belongs. As Gurmukh, reflect upon Him within your heart."
P0076L23,"Says Nanak, O mortal, in the first watch of the night, dwell upon the Lord, who shall shower you with His Grace. ||1||"
P0076L24,"In the second watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the mind is attached to the love of duality."
P0076L25,"Mother and father hug you close in their embrace, claiming, """"He is mine, he is mine""""; so is the child brought up, O my merchant friend."
P0076L26,"Your mother and father constantly hug you close in their embrace; in their minds, they believe that you will provide for them and support them."
P0076L27,"The fool does not know the One who gives; instead, he clings to the gift."
P0076L28,"Rare is the Gurmukh who reflects upon, meditates upon, and within his mind, is lovingly attached to the Lord."
P0076L29,"Says Nanak, in the second watch of the night, O mortal, death never devours you. ||2||"
P0076L30,"In the third watch of the night, O my merchant friend, your mind is entangled in worldly and household affairs."
P0076L31,"You think of wealth, and gather wealth, O my merchant friend, but you do not contemplate the Lord or the Lord's Name."
P0076L32,"You never dwell upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, who will be your only Helper and Support in the end."
P0077L01,"This wealth, property and Maya are false. In the end, you must leave these, and depart in sorrow."
P0077L02,"Those whom the Lord, in His Mercy, unites with the Guru, reflect upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har."
P0077L03,"Says Nanak, in the third watch of the night, O mortal, they go, and are united with the Lord. ||3||"
P0077L04,"In the fourth watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the Lord announces the time of departure."
P0077L05,"Serve the Perfect True Guru, O my merchant friend; your entire life-night is passing away."
P0077L06,Serve the Lord each and every instant-do not delay! You shall become eternal throughout the ages.
P0077L07,"Enjoy ecstasy forever with the Lord, and do away with the pains of birth and death."
P0077L08,"Know that there is no difference between the Guru, the True Guru, and your Lord and Master. Meeting with Him, take pleasure in the Lord's devotional service."
P0077L09,"Says Nanak, O mortal, in the fourth watch of the night, the life-night of the devotee is fruitful. ||4||1||3||"
P0077L10,"Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:"
P0077L11,"In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the Lord placed your soul in the womb."
P0077L12,"In the tenth month, you were made into a human being, O my merchant friend, and you were given your allotted time to perform good deeds."
P0077L13,"You were given this time to perform good deeds, according to your pre-ordained destiny."
P0077L14,"God placed you with your mother, father, brothers, sons and wife."
P0077L15,"God Himself is the Cause of causes, good and bad-no one has control over these things."
P0077L16,"Says Nanak, O mortal, in the first watch of the night, the soul is placed in the womb. ||1||"
P0077L17,"In the second watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the fullness of youth rises in you like waves."
P0077L18,"You do not distinguish between good and evil, O my merchant friend-your mind is intoxicated with ego."
P0077L19,"Mortal beings do not distinguish between good and evil, and the road ahead is treacherous."
P0077L20,"They never serve the Perfect True Guru, and the cruel tyrant Death stands over their heads."
P0077L21,"When the Righteous Judge seizes you and interrogates you, O madman, what answer will you give him then?"
P0077L22,"Says Nanak, in the second watch of the night, O mortal, the fullness of youth tosses you about like waves in the storm. ||2||"
P0077L23,"In the third watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the blind and ignorant person gathers poison."
P0077L24,"He is entangled in emotional attachment to his wife and sons, O my merchant friend, and deep within him, the waves of greed are rising up."
P0077L25,"The waves of greed are rising up within him, and he does not remember God."
P0077L26,"He does not join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and he suffers in terrible pain through countless incarnations."
P0077L27,"He has forgotten the Creator, his Lord and Master, and he does not meditate on Him, even for an instant."
P0077L28,"Says Nanak, in the third watch of the night, the blind and ignorant person gathers poison. ||3||"
P0077L29,"In the fourth watch of the night, O my merchant friend, that day is drawing near."
P0077L30,"As Gurmukh, remember the Naam, O my merchant friend. It shall be your Friend in the Court of the Lord."
P0077L31,"As Gurmukh, remember the Naam, O mortal; in the end, it shall be your only companion."
P0078L01,This emotional attachment to Maya shall not go with you; it is false to fall in love with it.
P0078L02,"The entire night of your life has passed away in darkness; but by serving the True Guru, the Divine Light shall dawn within."
P0078L03,"Says Nanak, O mortal, in the fourth watch of the night, that day is drawing near! ||4||"
P0078L04,"Receiving the summons from the Lord of the Universe, O my merchant friend, you must arise and depart with the actions you have committed."
P0078L05,"You are not allowed a moment's delay, O my merchant friend; the Messenger of Death seizes you with firm hands."
P0078L06,"Receiving the summons, people are seized and dispatched. The self-willed manmukhs are miserable forever."
P0078L07,But those who serve the Perfect True Guru are forever happy in the Court of the Lord.
P0078L08,"The body is the field of karma in this age; whatever you plant, you shall harvest."
P0078L09,"Says Nanak, the devotees look beautiful in the Court of the Lord; the self-willed manmukhs wander forever in reincarnation. ||5||1||4||"

P0078L13,"When the Lord Himself grants His Grace, the Gurmukh learns the duties of her Husband's Celestial Home."
P0078L14,"The Gurmukh learns the duties of her Husband's Celestial Home; she meditates forever on the Lord, Har, Har."
P0078L15,"She walks happily among her companions, and in the Lord's Court, she swings her arms joyfully."
P0078L16,"Her account is cleared by the Righteous Judge of Dharma, when she chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har."
P0078L17,"The ignorant soul-bride becomes Gurmukh, and gains the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, while she is still in her father's house. ||1||"
P0078L18,"My marriage has been performed, O my father. As Gurmukh, I have found the Lord."
P0078L19,The darkness of ignorance has been dispelled. The Guru has revealed the blazing light of spiritual wisdom.
P0078L20,"This spiritual wisdom given by the Guru shines forth, and the darkness has been dispelled. I have found the Priceless Jewel of the Lord."
P0078L21,"The sickness of my ego has been dispelled, and my pain is over and done. Through the Guru's Teachings, my identity has consumed my identical identity."

P0078L27,"Fruitful are the lives of those who, as Gurmukh, have conquered their minds-they have won the game of life."
P0078L28,"Joining with the humble Saints of the Lord, my actions bring prosperity, and I have obtained the Lord of Bliss as my Husband."
P0078L29,"The Lord is the Truest of the True, O my father. Joining with the humble servants of the Lord, the marriage party has been embellished. ||3||"
P0078L30,"O my father, give me the Name of the Lord God as my wedding gift and dowry."
P0079L01,"Give me the Lord as my wedding gown, and the Lord as my glory, to accomplish my works."

P0079L03,"Across the continents, and throughout the Universe, the Lord's Glory is pervading. This gift is not diminished by being diffused among all."
P0079L04,"Any other dowry, which the self-willed manmukhs offer for show, is only false egotism and a worthless display."
P0079L05,"O my father, please give me the Name of the Lord God as my wedding gift and dowry. ||4||"
